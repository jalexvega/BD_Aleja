	abstract = {Excavation and material stockpiling activities in the mining process cause a change in the distribution of forces and stresses in the material. As a result, the material will seek a new equilibrium by releasing the load through a landslide. As part of mitigation, it is necessary to monitor displacements occurring on slopes using high-accuracy devices. Ground-based radar is a technique considered to have good ability to detect displacements in real-time. However, ground-based radar has a weakness in that it cannot detect vertical displacement. One of the emerging technologies that is used for monitoring vertical displacements as LoS displacements is D-InSAR analysis. With the integration of both methods, displacements that occur horizontally and vertically on a slope can be detected properly. In addition, the decrease in rock mass strength due to displacement can be predicted based on numerical analysis using the finite element method. Monitoring was carried out from December 10th, 2021 to April 9th, 2022.  The monitoring results from the beginning to the end of the period showed that the horizontal and vertical displacements that occurred in the low wall area were 1247.34 mm and 292.5 mm, respectively. Correlated with these conditions, the Young’s modulus value of the rock mass decreased between 3\% and 35\%.},

	abstract = {SAR interferometry (InSAR) has emerged in the big-data era, particularly benefitting from the acquisition capability and open-data policy of ESA’s Sentinel-1 SAR mission. A large number of Sentinel-1 SAR images have been acquired and archived, allowing for the generation of thousands of interferograms, covering millions of square kilometers. In such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the derived velocity map. Here, we present a strategy facilitated by the deep learning networks to firstly detect the localized deformation and then carry out the time-series analysis on small interferogram patches with deformation signals. Specifically, we report following-up studies of our proposed deep learning networks for masking decorrelation areas, detecting local deformation, and unwrapping high-gradient phases. In the applications of mining-induced subsidence monitoring and slow-moving landslide detection, the presented strategy not only reduces the computation time, but also avoids the influence of large-scale tropospheric delays and unwrapping errors. The presented detection-first strategy introduces deep learning to the time-series InSAR processing chain and makes the mission of operationally monitoring localized deformation feasible and efficient for the large-scale InSAR.},

In recent years, micro-deformation monitoring radar has been widely used in mine slope landslide monitoring. However, traditional landslide prediction methods are not able to make full use of the diversified monitoring data from these radars. This paper proposes a landslide time prediction method based on the time series monitoring data of micro-deformation monitoring radar. Specifically, deformation displacement, coherence and deformation volume, and the parametric degree of deformation (DOD) are calculated and combined with the use of the tangent angle method. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by using measured data of a landslide in a mining area. The experimental results show that our proposed method can be used to identify the characteristics of an imminent sliding slope and landslide in advance, providing monitoring personnel with more reliable landslide prediction results.},

To this end, this article proposed a new machine-learning method for slope deformation prediction. Ground-based interferometric radar (GB-SAR) was employed to collect the slope deformation data from an open-pit mine. Then, an ensemble learner, which aggregated a set of weaker learners, was proposed to mine the GB-SAR field data, delivering a slope deformation prediction model. The evaluation of the field data acquired from the Anjialing open-pit mine demonstrates that the proposed slope deformation model was able to precisely predict the slope deformation of the monitored mine. The prediction accuracy of the super learner was superior to those of all the independent weaker learners.},

	abstract = {The Okgye limestone mine, which is the largest open-pit limestone mine located in a mountainous area in Korea, suffered a collapse in 2012 that claimed four casualties. Restoration work on the rocky mined-out slopes, as well as mining and dumping activities, are still in progress. Monitoring slope stability is important to prevent the sudden collapse of slopes, which can be efficiently performed by satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. Firstly, we obtained elevation changes using InSAR-generated Copernicus 30 m DEM in 2014 and an SRTM 1Sec DEM in 2000, through which the area was roughly classified into the mining area, tailings storage area, and the mined-out area. A time series of 12-day coherence images produced by Sentinel-1B SAR were averaged annually to produce an RGB-composite image to observe the change in mining activities during 2018, 2019, and 2020. We found many persistent scatterers (PS) when observing the ground displacement, both in the ascending and descending orbits, from which we decomposed this into the vertical and east components. The largest displacement of 63.6 mm/year was observed during 2019 and 2020 in the tailings storage area in the direction of the dumping slope. For the rocky outcrops and the transmission tower, we found a seasonal oscillation, which can be interpreted as the thermal expansion of limestone and iron. This paper demonstrated that the surface stability and deformation of open-pit mines could be effectively monitored by combining InSAR DEM, coherence, and PSInSAR techniques.},

First, the subtraction of SRTM DEM (2000) from TanDEM-X DEM (2010–2015) has identified two major accumulation areas, one in the east (+112.33 m) and the other in the west (+84.03 m), and a major excavation area (−42.54 m) at the center of the mine. A total of 89 high-quality coherence images with a 12-day baseline from 2015 to 2020 were converted to the normalized difference activity index (NDAI), a newly developed activity indicator robust to spatial and temporal decorrelation. An RGB composite of annually averaged NDAI maps (red for 2019, green for 2018, and blue for 2017) showed that overall activity has diminished since 2018. Dumping slopes were categorized into shrinking, expanding, or transitional, according to the color pattern. Migration and expansion of excavation sites were also found on the pit floor. Time series of 12-day NDAI graphs revealed the date of activities with monthly accuracy. It is believed that NDAI with continuous acquisition of Sentinel-1A/B data can provide detailed monitoring of various types of activities in open-pit mines especially with limited in situ data.},

In this article, surface geophysics scanning by ground penetrating radar (GPR) is presented for the detection of vertical joints at one of the largest open-pit coal mines in Australia.

              Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has been widely used in landslide deformation monitoring in the past decade. It has the advantages of high monitoring accuracy, a wide range, and flexibility allowing all-weather continuous monitoring. The self-developed S-SAR synthetic aperture radar (slope radar) is the first completely domestic-made radar used in slope deformation monitoring equipment in China, and its performance and technical parameters are equal to or better than similar products made abroad. The characteristics of deformation data collected by S-SAR slope radar deployed in the front open pit mine are analyzed to further develop a spatio-temporal landslide prediction method which is applicable to the massive monitoring data within the monitoring range of slope radar. The intersection points of short-term moving average velocity curve and long-term moving average velocity curve of slope deformation, which are onset of acceleration (OOA) and termination of acceleration (TOA). When OOA occurs, the deformation will accelerate, and when TOA occurs, the deformation will tend to stabilize. The OOA can identify areas at risk in the monitored area before failure, so that the spatial position prediction of landslide early warning can be realized. Based on the assumptions of the inverse velocity method, a
              T
              -log (
              t
              ) logarithmic model is established, and the updated monitoring data are corrected to approximate the time of failure, thus improving the accuracy of landslide location and time prediction. In an open-pit copper mine in Serbia, the accurate prediction of landslide location and time has been successfully applied, guaranteeing safe mining.},

	abstract = {Slope failures pose a substantial threat to mining activity due to their destructive potential and high probability of occurrence on steep slopes close to limit equilibrium conditions, which are often found both in open pits and in waste and tailing disposal facilities. The development of slope monitoring and modeling programs usually entails the exploitation of in situ and remote sensing data, together with the application of numerical modeling, and it plays an important role in the definition of prevention and mitigation measures aimed at minimizing the impact of slope failures in mining areas. In this paper, a new methodology is presented; one that combines satellite radar interferometry and 2D finite element modeling for slope stability analysis at a regional scale, and applied within slope unit polygons. Although the literature includes many studies applying radar interferometry and modeling for slope stability analysis, the addition of slope units as input data for radar interferometry and modeling purposes has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. A former mining area in southeast Spain was studied, and the method proved useful for detecting and characterizing a large number of unstable slopes. Out of the 1959 slope units used for the spatial analysis of the radar interferometry data, 43 were unstable, with varying values of safety factor and landslide size. Out of the 43 active slope units, 21 exhibited line of sight velocities greater than the maximum error obtained through validation analysis (2.5 cm/year). Finally, this work discusses the possibility of using the results of the proposed approach to devise a proxy for landslide hazard. The proposed methodology can help to provide non-expert final users with intelligible, clear, and easily comparable information to analyze slope instabilities in different settings, and not limited to mining areas.},

            This paper explores the potential of using satellite radar inteferometry to monitor time-varying land movement prior to any visible tension crack signs. The idea was developed during dedicated geotechnical studies at a large open-pit lignite mine, where large slope movements (10–20 mm/day) were monitored and large fissures were observed in the immediate area outside the current pit limits. In this work, differential interferometry (DInSAR), using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ALOS images, was applied to monitor the progression of land movement that could potentially thwart mine operations. Early signs of land movements were captured by this technique well before their visual observation. Moreover, a qualitative comparison of DInSAR and ground geodetic measurements indicates that the technique can be used for the identification of high risk areas and, subsequently, for the optimization of the spatial distribution of the available ground monitoring equipment. Finally, quantitative land movement results from DInSAR are shown to be in accordance with simultaneous measurements obtained by ground means.},

	abstract = {The Xishan coal mine area in Beijing, China has a long history of mining. Many landslide hazards, in addition to collapses and ground fractures, have occurred in this area. This study used multi-temporal satellite images to extract this region’s deformation information, identify landslides and analyze the deformation evolution process of these landslides. Taking the Anzigou ditch as an example, we investigate the “Quarry–Landslide–Mudslide” disaster chain model. We found that the landslide evolution process is closely related to the geological conditions, and usually goes through four stages: initial deformation, slope front swelling and collapsing, rear part connecting and rupturing, and landslide creeping. The surface deformation can be identified and tracked by high-resolution optical images and InSAR monitoring. Under the combined effects of rainfall and topographic conditions, medium and large landslides may occur and trigger a “Quarry–Landslide–Mudflow” disaster chain. The identification and analysis of these landslide hazards and the disaster chain help with geological disaster prevention, and provide reference for early identification and research of similar disasters.},

SBAS‐InSAR technology enables the processing of SAR images to obtain highly accurate surface deformation information.

              January 2021. The data were adopted to analyze the characteristics of deformation in the study region and the mining areas, and the subsidence accumulation was compared with field GNSS observation results to verify its accuracy. The results showed that the study area settled significantly, with a maximum settlement rate of −44.80 mm/a and a maximum uplift rate of 28.04 mm/a. The maximum settlement and accumulation of the whole study area over the three‐year period were −129.39 mm and 60.49 mm, respectively. The mining area had a settlement value of over 80 mm over the three years. Significantly, the settlement rates of the tailings and active areas were −35 mm/a and −40 mm/a, respectively. Debris accumulation in the eastern portion of the tailings and active areas near the mountain was serious, with accumulation rates of 25 mm/a and 20 mm/a, respectively, and both had accumulation amounts of around 70 mm. For mine tailing pile areas with river flows, the pile locations and environmental restoration should be appropriately adjusted at a later stage. For gravel pile areas, regular cleaning should be carried out, especially around the mining site and at the tunnel entrances and exits, and long‐term deformation monitoring of these areas should be carried out to ensure safe operation of the mining site. The SBAS‐InSAR measurements were able to yield deformations with high accuracies over a wide area and cost less human and financial resources than the GNSS measurement method. Furthermore, the measurement results were more macroscopic, with great application value for surface subsidence monitoring in alpine areas.},

	abstract = {Persistent Scatterer interferometry (PSI) represents a powerful tool for the detection and monitoring of tiny surface deformations in vast areas, allowing a better understanding of its triggering mechanisms, planning of mitigation measures, as well as to find better solutions for social and environmental issues. However, there is no record hitherto of its use in active open pit mine in tropical rainforest environment. In this paper we evaluate the use of the PSI technique for the detection and monitoring of mine slope deformations in the N4W iron mine and its surroundings, Pará State, Northern Brazil. The PSI processing was performed with 18 ascending SAR scenes of the TerraSAR-X satellite acquired in the dry season of 2012. The results showed a significant number of widely distributed persistent scatterers. It was observed that most of the study area was stable during the time span. Nevertheless, high deformation rates (312 mm/year) were mapped over the mine waste piles, but do not offer any hazard, since they are expected displacements of meters in magnitude for these manmade land structures. Additionally, it was mapped tiny deformation rates in both the east and west flanks of pits 1 and 2. The main underlying reasons can be assigned to the accommodation phenomena of very poor rock masses, to the local geometric variations of the slope cuts, to the geological contact between ironstones and the country rocks, to the exploitation activities, as well as to the major geological structures. This study showed the applicability of the PSI technique using TerraSAR-X scenes in active open pit mines in tropical moist environment. However, the PSI technique is not capable in providing real-time warnings, and faces limitations due to SAR viewing geometry. In this sense, we strongly recommend the use of radar scenes acquired in both ascending and descending orbits, which would also provide a more complete understanding of the deformation patterns.},

This paper presents a newly proposed early warning time-of-failure (TOF) analysis procedure for use in real-time with ground-based radar measurements designed to be integrated in an open-pit mine’s trigger action response plan (TARP). The inverse-velocity and slope gradient (SLO) TOF analysis methods are applied to radar displacement measurements using a new systematic multi-pixel selection technique termed the “percent deformation method.” The utilization of the percent deformation method in the proposed real-time TOF analysis methodology gives more-reliable results than current practice by providing recommendations for pixel selections, data filtering, where and how to undertake TOF analyses, and presenting TOF results in real time. The addition of a more rigorous, methodical treatment of radar monitoring data when faced with critical slope instability will reduce uncertainty and increase confidence in any trigger action response decisions, helping to ensure a safer work environment.},

In this work, the complete archives of the European Space Agency (ESA)’s European Remote-Sensing (ERS-1/2) missions and European Commission’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 constellation were screened to select synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images covering the most severe and recent ENSO-related flooding events that affected Lima, the capital and largest city of Peru, in 1997–1998 and 2017–2018. Based on SAR backscatter color composites and ratio maps retrieved from a series of pre-, cross- and post-event SAR pairs, flooded areas were delineated within the Rímac River watershed. These are mostly concentrated along the riverbanks and plain, where low-lying topography and gentle slopes (≤5°), together with the presence of alluvial deposits, also indicate greater susceptibility to flooding. A total of 409 areas (58.50 km2) revealing change were mapped, including 197 changes (32.10 km2) due to flooding-related backscatter variations (flooded areas, increased water flow in the riverbed, and riverbank collapses and damage), and 212 (26.40 km2) due to other processes (e.g., new urban developments, construction of river embankments, other engineering works, vegetation changes). Urban and landscape changes potentially contributing, either detrimentally or beneficially, to flooding susceptibility were identified and considered in the overall assessment of risk. The extent of built-up areas within the basin was mapped by combining information from the 2011 Global Urban Footprint (GUF) produced by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Open Street Map (OSM) accessed from the Quantum GIS (QGIS) service, and 2011–2019 very high-resolution optical imagery from Google Earth. The resulting flooding risk map highlights the sectors of potential concern along the Rímac River, should flooding events of equal severity as those captured by SAR images occur in the future.},

Its application capability has recently been emphasized by the Sentinel-1 satellite mission, providing extensive spatial coverage, regular temporal sampling and free data availability. We perform MT-InSAR analysis over the wider Upper Nitra region in Slovakia, utilizing all Sentinel-1 images acquired since November 2014 until March 2017. This region is notable for its extensive landslide susceptibility as well as intensive brown coal mining. We focus on two case studies, being impaired by recent activation of these geohazards, which caused serious damage to local structures. We incorporate a processing chain based on open-source tools, combining the current Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) implementation. MT-InSAR results reveal substantial activity at both case studies, exceeding the annual displacement velocities of 30 mm/year. Moreover, our observations are validated and their accuracy is confirmed via comparison with ground truth data from borehole inclinometers and terrestrial levelling. Detected displacement time series provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of corresponding deformation phenomena and are thus complementary to conventional terrestrial monitoring techniques. At the same time, they not only demonstrate the feasibility of MT-InSAR for the assessment of remediation works, but also constitute the possibility of operational monitoring and routine landslide inventory updates, regarding the free Sentinel-1 data.},

	abstract = {Ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GBSAR) has the advantage of retrieving submillimeter deformation of the mine slope by using the differential interferometry technique, which is important for safe production in mining applications. However, the moving vehicle’s defocus/displaced signal will mask the SAR image of the mining area which affects the accuracy of interference phase extraction and deformation inversion. In order to remove its influence, the moving target can first be refocused and then removed. To our knowledge, there is no GBSAR moving target refocusing method currently. Hence, the refocusing method is necessary. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a single-channel FMCW-GBSAR moving target refocusing method based on relative speed. Firstly, the FMCW-GBSAR moving target signal model is analyzed, and then the relative speed based signal model is deduced. Based on the model and GBSAR’s feature of incomplete synthetic aperture, the Range Doppler (RD) algorithm is adopted and improved to achieve refocusing using relative speed parameters. The algorithm is controlled by relative speed and squint angle; thus, the refocused target image can be obtained via searching 2D parameters. The proposed method is verified by the synthetic data, which are generated by combining NCUT FMCW GBSAR real data and simulated moving target echo.},

            Early alarm systems can activate vital precautions for saving lives and the economy threatened by natural hazards and human activities. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products generate valuable ground motion data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Integrating the InSAR products and forecasting models make possible to set up early alarm systems to monitor vulnerable areas. This study proposes a technical support to early warning detection tools of ground instabilities using machine learning and InSAR time series that is capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is tailored to predict ground movements in three forecast ranges (i.e., SAR observations): 3, 4, and 5 multistep. A contribution of the proposed strategy is utilizing adjacent time series to decrease the possibility of falsely detecting safe regions as significant movements. The proposed tool offers ground motion-based outcomes that can be interpreted and utilized by experts to activate early alarms to reduce the consequences of possible failures in vulnerable infrastructures, such as mining areas. Three case studies in Spain, Brazil, and Australia, where fatal incidents happened, are analyzed by the proposed early alert detector to illustrate the impact of chosen temporal and spatial ranges. Since most early alarm systems are site dependent, we propose a general tool to be interpreted by experts for activating reliable alarms. The results show that the proposed tool can identify potential regions before collapse in all case studies. In addition, the tool can suggest an optimum selection of InSAR temporal (i.e., number of images) and spatial (i.e., adjacent measurement points) combinations based on the available SAR images and the characteristics of the study area.},

The combination of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology and the probability integral method (PIM) is commonly used for predicting deformation. However, most surface subsidence prediction in mining areas is based on the static PIM parameters, failing to achieve the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic deformation prediction. This paper proposed a 3D deformation dynamic prediction model (InSAR-3D-CTPIM) between InSAR deformation observations and dynamic coordinate-time PIM (CTPIM) parameters, which can realize the prediction of east–west, north–south, and vertical series deformation caused by mining. The method has been validated by simulation experiments and real experiments in the mining area of Jiansheng Coal Mine in Baisha Reservoir, Henan Province, China. The results showed that the modeling accuracy was improved by 34.3\% compared to the traditional multi-rate model, and the accuracy was improved by 28.5\% compared to the vertical deformation obtained by the traditional static PIM method. The InSAR-3D-CTPIM model can be used to predict the evolutionary history of basin-wide surface deformation dynamics in coal mining areas, and provide a reference for the early warning and prediction of geological hazards in coal mining areas.},

The deformation monitoring and mechanical behavior analysis of the mining area helps reveal the typical mountain deformation and failure mechanism caused by underground mining activities and reduce the risk of mountain collapse in the mining area. In this manuscript, a research method for mountain stability in mining areas is proposed, which combines InSAR deformation monitoring with numerical analysis. Based on the high-precision deformation information obtained by DS-InSAR and the landslide range, a three-dimensional explicit finite difference numerical analysis method was used to reconstruct the landslide model. According to the layout of the coal mining working face, the variation mechanism of overlying stratum stress and the mountain slip in the coal mining process is inverted, and the mechanism of mountain failure and instability in the mining area is analysed. Based on the sentinel data, the experiment performed time series monitoring and inversion analysis of the mountain collapse in Nayong, Guizhou, China. The results show that mining activities a certain distance from the mountain will affect mountain stability, and there are specific mechanisms. From 2015 to 2017, the stress redistribution of overlying strata above the goaf area resulted in dense longitudinal cracks in the landslide body due to coal mining. The mountain is in a continuous damage state, and the supporting force to prevent collapse continues to decrease, resulting in a gradual decrease in landslide stability. Both the time series DS-InSAR monitoring results and numerical simulation results verify the actual occurrence and development of the on-site subsidence.},

In this technical note, a commercial, cost-effective method combining a network of geotechnical surface sensors with the InSAR data was reported for the first time to accurately monitor surface displacement. The correlation of both data sets is demonstrated in the Gediminas Castle testbed, where slope failure events were detected. Two specific events were analyzed, and possible causes proposed. The combination of techniques allows one to detect the precursors of the events and characterize the consequences of the failures in different areas in proximity to the castle walls, since the solution allows for the confirmation of long-term drifts and sudden movements in real time. The data from the in situ sensors were also used to refine the satellite data analysis. The results demonstrate that not all events pose a direct threat to the safety of the structure monitored.},

	abstract = {The most dangerous exogenous geological processes (EGP) in terms of the amount of damage caused to economic objects include: landslides, karst, flooding, abrasion, mudslides, etc. The distribution and intensity of EGP are determined by the peculiarities of geological and geomorphological structure of the territory, its tectonic, neotectonic and seismic regime, as well as hydrological, climatic, hydrogeological paleo- and modern conditions. Solotvynsky salt mine is one of the oldest enterprises in Transcarpathia. The field has been exploited since the Roman Empire. In 1360, a settlement of salt miners, Solotvyno, was founded on the site of the mine, which later became a center of salt production and a royal monopoly. There are a total of nine mines in the field. In 1995-1996 and 2001, floods began flooding mines. In 2005, landslides and karst abysses intensified in Solotvyno, leading to damage to residential buildings, roads and infrastructure. There was a complete flooding of the mines of two mines. Currently, dangerous natural and man-made processes are observed on the territory of the salt mine and adjacent territories. This is mainly salt karst, both underground and surface, the collapse of areas in the location of mines, as well as landslides. Therefore, the purpose of the research is to conduct a geodynamic audit of SOLOTVYNSKY SALT MINE SE and the surrounding area with the possibility of identifying areas with subsidence or rise of the earth's surface, which are gradually slowing down, accelerating or developing at a constant rate.                     Output data. Radar interferometry data in the period from April 30, 2016 to June 25, 2018 were used for research and performance of geodynamic audit of SOLOTVYNSKY SALT MINE SE and the adjacent territory. Modern methods of interferometric processing of satellite radar data are used in the work: the method of "PS" – the method of constant scatterers, and the method SBAS – the method of small baselines. The method of geometric leveling was used to measure vertical displacements in some places on the earth's surface in order to verify interferometric data. Monitoring of the area of interest was carried out using modern technologies of satellite radar interferometry. According to the results of observations of landslides and individual objects by space (radar interferometry) and ground (geometric leveling) methods, a high correlation of data was recorded and the presence of zones of active subsidence in the mining area was confirmed.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry – PSI have been largely employed to predict instabilities and failure in open pit mines. The PSI is a powerful technique, which combines radar satellite data in order to detect and monitor tiny surface displacements over vast areas. In the last years, the Sentinel-1 radar mission have produced images of the globe acquired with different spatial and temporal resolutions that are now freely available. In recent years, the footwall slopes of the Riacho dos Machados Gold Mine – MRDM (Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil) have recorded large planar failures controlled by foliation planes. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to evaluate a stack of 39 Interferometric Wide Sentinel-1 scenes, spanning from January 2018 to April 2019, acquired in descending orbit geometry, for the detection and monitoring of surface displacements in the MRDM. The results have shown that descending IW Sentinel-1 scenes can be used to provide a broad picture of the Line-Of-Sight - LOS deformation phenomena. In order to monitor the evolution of the deformation phenomena induced by mining activities, LOS deformation maps with millimeter accuracy could be only delivered at least each 12 days.},

The results show that the settlement and deformation areas shown by numerical simulation and InSAR monitoring results are consistent; the comparison between InSAR monitoring results and rainfall intensity shows that the cumulative value of slope settlement has a high correlation with heavy rainfall. The safety coefficients of the slopes of the open pit under natural conditions and rainfall conditions are 1.50 and 1.21, the cumulative value of settlement in InSAR monitoring data for one year is 18.4 mm, and no obvious large deformation area is found.

	abstract = {Coal mining leads to surface subsidence, landslides, soil erosion and other problems that seriously threaten the life and property safety of residents in mining areas, and it is urgent to obtain mining subsidence information using high-frequency, high-precision and large-scale monitoring methods. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the deformation monitoring of the Datong mining area using Lutan-1 monostatic and bistatic SAR data. Firstly, the latest Lutan-1 bistatic data are used to reconstruct the DSM, and the interferometric calibration method is used to improve the accuracy of the DSM. Then, the surface deformation monitoring of the mining area is implemented by using DInSAR, SBAS-InSAR and Stacking-InSAR with the reconstructed DSM data and Lutan-1 monostatic SAR data. Finally, the deformation monitoring results are compared with the surface deformation results based on the TanDEM data, and both the results are evaluated using the filed leveling data. Taking 20 images covering the Datong mining area as the data sources, the surface deformation results obtained using different InSAR methods in the mining area were quantitatively evaluated and analyzed. The results indicated that: (1) the DSM obtained using the Lutan-1 bistatic SAR data was assessed and demonstrated with the ICESat laser altimetry data an error of 2.8 m, which meets the Chinese 1:50,000 scale DEM cartographic accuracy standard, and the difference analysis with the TanDEM data shows that the terrain changes are mainly distributed in mountainous areas; (2) Due to the improvement in resolution, the registration accuracy of the SAR images and LT-DSM is higher than that of the TanDEM data in the range direction and azimuth direction; (3) Via evaluation with the filed leveling data, it is found that the surface deformation measurement results based on LT-DSM are less affected by terrain, and the accuracy of LT-DSM-SBAS and LT-DSM-DInSAR is improved by 11.5\% and 16.3\%, respectively, compared with TanDEM-SBAS and TanDEM-DInSAR, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Lutan-1 bistatic and monostatic data for mine deformation monitoring.},

As a consequence, and mainly in building agglomerations, the structures can be damaged severely during or after underground extraction, with risks to human life. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a combination of a differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technique and a support vector machine (SVM) regression algorithm optimized by grid search (GS-SVR) to predict mining subsidence in a timely and cost-efficient manner. We consider five Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images encompassing the Dafosi coal mine area in Binxian and Changwu counties, Shaanxi Province. The results show that the subsidence predicted by the proposed InSAR and GS-SVR approach is consistent with the Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. The maximum absolute errors are less than 3.1 cm and the maximum relative errors are less than 14\%. The proposed approach combining DInSAR with GS-SVR technology can predict mining subsidence on the Loess Plateau of China with a high level of accuracy. This research may also help to provide disaster warnings.},

	abstract = {Mining industry faces new technological and economic challenges which need to be overcome in order to raise it to a new technological level in accordance with the ideas of Industry 4.0. Mining companies are searching for new possibilities of optimizing and automating processes, as well as for using digital technology and modern computer software to aid technological processes. Every stage of deposit management requires mining engineers, geologists, surveyors, and environment protection specialists who are involved in acquiring, storing, processing, and sharing data related to the parameters describing the deposit, its exploitation and the environment. These data include inter alia: geometries of the deposit, of the excavations, of the overburden and of the mined mineral, borders of the support pillars and of the buffer zones, mining advancements with respect to the set borders, effects of mining activities on the ground surface, documentation of landslide hazards and of the impact of mining operations on the selected elements of the environment. Therefore, over the life cycle of a deposit, modern digital technological solutions should be implemented in order to automate the processes of acquiring, sharing, processing and analyzing data related to deposit management. In accordance with this idea, the article describes the results of a measurement experiment performed in the Mikoszów open-pit granite mine (Lower Silesia, SW Poland) with the use of mobile LiDAR systems. The technology combines active sensors with automatic and global navigation system synchronized on a mobile platform in order to generate an accurate and precise geospatial 3D cloud of points.},

	abstract = {The collapse of open-pit coal mine slopes is a kind of severe geological hazard that may cause resource waste, economic loss, and casualties. On 22 February 2023, a large-scale collapse occurred at the Xinjing Open-Pit Mine in Inner Mongolia, China, leading to the loss of 53 lives. Thus, monitoring of the slope stability is important for preventing similar potential damage. It is difficult to fully obtain the temporal and spatial information of the whole mining area using conventional ground monitoring technologies. Therefore, in this study, multi-source remote sensing methods, combined with local geological conditions, are employed to monitor the open-pit mine and analyze the causes of the accident. Firstly, based on GF-2 data, remote sensing interpretation methods are used to locate and analyze the collapse area. The results indicate that high-resolution remote sensing can delineate the collapse boundary, supporting the post-disaster rescue. Subsequently, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A satellite data, covering the period from mining to collapse, are integrated with D-InSAR and DS-InSAR technologies to monitor the deformation of both the collapse areas and the potential risk to dump slopes. The D-InSAR result suggests that high-intensity open-pit mining may be the dominant factor affecting deformation. Furthermore, the boundary between the collapse trailing edge and the non-collapse area could be found in the DS-InSAR result. Moreover, various data sources, including DEM and geological data, are combined to analyze the causes and trends of the deformation. The results suggest that the dump slopes are stable. Meanwhile, the deformation trends of the collapse slope indicate that there may be faults or joint surfaces of the collapse trailing edge boundary. The slope angle exceeding the designed value during the mining is the main cause of the collapse. In addition, the thawing of soil moisture caused by the increase in temperature and the reduction in the mechanical properties of the rock and soil due to underground voids and coal fires also contributed to the accident. This study demonstrates that multi-source remote sensing technologies can quickly and accurately identify potential high-risk areas, which is of great significance for pre-disaster warning and post-disaster rescue.},

	abstract = {Satellite interferometric data are widely exploited for ground motion monitoring thanks to their wide area coverage, cost efficiency and non-invasiveness. The launch of the Sentinel-1 constellation opened new horizons for interferometric applications, allowing the scientists to rethink the way in which these data are delivered, passing from a static view of the territory to a continuous streaming of ground motion measurements from space. Tuscany Region is the first worldwide example of a regional scale monitoring system based on satellite interferometric data. The processing chain here exploited combines a multi-interferometric approach with a time-series data mining algorithm aimed at recognizing benchmarks with significant trend variations. The system is capable of detecting the temporal changes of a wide variety of phenomena such as slow-moving landslides and subsidence, producing a high amount of data to be interpreted in a short time. Bulletins and reports are derived to the hydrogeological risk management actors at regional scale. The final output of the project is a list of potentially hazardous and accelerating phenomena that are verified on site by field campaign by completing a sheet survey in order to qualitatively estimate the risk and to suggest short-term actions to be taken by local entities. Two case studies, one related to landslides and one to subsidence, are proposed to highlight the potential of the monitoring system to early detect anomalous ground changes. Both examples represent a successful implementation of satellite interferometric data as monitoring and risk management tools, raising the awareness of local and regional authorities to geohazards.},

              We demonstrate the potential of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to identify precursors to catastrophic slope failures. To date, early-warning has mostly relied on the availability of detailed, high-frequency data from sensors installed
              in situ
              . The same purpose could not be chased through spaceborne monitoring applications, as these could not yield information acquired in sufficiently systematic fashion. Here we present three sets of Sentinel-1 constellation images processed by means of multi-interferometric analysis. We detect clear trends of accelerating displacement prior to the catastrophic failure of three large slopes of very different nature: an open-pit mine slope, a natural rock slope in alpine terrain, and a tailings dam embankment. We determine that these events could have been located several days or weeks in advance. The results highlight that satellite InSAR may now be used to support decision making and enhance predictive ability for this type of hazard.},

	abstract = {Due to the intrinsic side-looking geometry of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), time series interferometric SAR is only able to monitor displacements in line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which limits the accuracy of displacement measurement in landslide monitoring. This is because the LOS displacement is only a three dimensional projection of real displacement of a certain ground object. Targeting at this problem, a precise digital elevation model (DEM) assisted slope displacement retrieval method is proposed and applied to a case study over the high and steep slope of the Dagushan open pit mine. In the case study, the precise DEM generated by laser scanning is first used to minimize topographic residuals in small baseline subsets analysis. Then, the LOS displacements are converted to slope direction with assistance of the precise DEM. By comparing with ground measurements, relative root mean square errors (RMSE) of the estimated slope displacements reach approximately 12–13\% for the ascending orbit, and 5.4–9.2\% for the descending orbit in our study area. In order to validate the experimental results, comparison with microseism monitoring results is also conducted. Moreover, both results have found that the largest slope displacements occur on the slope part, with elevations varying from −138 m to −210 m, which corresponds to the landslide area. Moreover, there is a certain correlation with precipitation, as revealed by the displacement time series. The outcome of this article shows that rock mass structure, lithology, and precipitation are main factors affecting the stability of high and steep mining slopes.},

	abstract = {The settlement (or subsidence) of mine waste dump is likely to cause landslides, thereby imposing threats on the safety of human beings and other local properties. Hence, it is essential to accurately predict the settlement for the early-warning of settlement-induced geohazards. Traditional mechanical methods require
              in situ
              mechanical parameters and the geological structure of mine waste dump, narrowing their practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a remote sensing-based method for predicting the settlement of mine waste dump without the requirement for field observations. Firstly, the historical settlement and thickness of mine waste dump were measured by space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and photogrammetry techniques, respectively. Secondly, the temporal evolution of the settlement of mine waste dump was described by a secondary consolidation model. Thirdly, the parameters of the secondary consolidation model were inverted based on the InSAR-measured historical settlements and photogrammetry-estimated thickness. Finally, the evolution trend of the settlement of the mine waste dump was predicted with the secondary consolidation model and its inverted parameters. The proposed method was tested over a mine waste dump in Weijiamao open-pit mine, China. The result shows that the root mean square error of the predicted time-series settlement is about 0.8 cm. The presented method will be beneficial to the assessment and early-warning of the settlement-related geohazards of mine waste dumps over a large area.},

However, the precision of current prediction models is often restricted by the lack of pertinent data or imprecise model parameters. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an approach to predicting mine subsidence that leverages Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology and the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The proposed approach utilizes small baseline multiple-master high-coherent target (SBMHCT) interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology to monitor the mine surface and applies the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm to construct the prediction model. The Shigouyi coalfield in Ningxia Province, China was chosen as a study area, and time series ground subsidence data were obtained based on Sentinel-1A data from 9 March 2015 to 7 June 2016. To evaluate the proposed approach, the prediction accuracies of LSTM and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were compared. The results show that the proposed approach could accurately predict mine subsidence, with maximum absolute errors of less than 2 cm and maximum relative errors of less than 6\%. The findings demonstrate that combining InSAR technology with the LSTM algorithm is an effective and robust approach for predicting mine subsidence.},

We project the LOS measurements resulting from both geometries to a common reference system without applying any type of geometric restriction. As a projection system, we use the vertical direction in flat areas and the slope in steep topographies. We then identify and remove outliers and artifacts from the joint dataset to finally obtain a deformation map that combines the two acquisition perspectives. The results in the Atalaya pit are consistent with GNSS measurements. The movements observed in the rock dumps were unknown before this study. We demonstrate the great potential of the Sentinel-1 satellite as a complementary tool for monitoring systems in mining environments and we call for its use to be standardized to guarantee a safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources necessary for a just technological transition.},

GB-InSAR can construct high-resolution 2D images in a range-doppler plane. However, it is difficult for geo-engineers who are unfamiliar with radar monitoring geometry to interpret the results. Geometric mapping method has been applied to the co-registration of terrain models and radar images for the deformation zonation, but the mismatching correction with GB-InSAR and terrain model is not fully investigated by existing researches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method exploiting an optimum linear transformation based on ground control points (GCPs). The proposed method was evaluated on simulated data and a field campaign in an open pit mine. The deformation mapping result of the method was verified by a collapse event. The method proposed in this paper has an RMSE value ranging from 0.502 to 0.720[Formula: see text]m (@700[Formula: see text]m average monitoring range) when the average density of the terrain point cloud is 0.5[Formula: see text]m.

The stability assessment of these old rooms and pillar goafs is challenging due to their concealment, irregular mining patterns, and the long passage of time. The methodology developed in this study, based on “space-sky-earth” remote sensing such as InSAR to trace historical deformation, the UAV observation of current surface damage, and comparison of mining spaces, can rapidly detect on a large scale the collapse of old goafs and the trend of damage. This study is conducted with an example of a coal mine in Yulin, Northern China, where obtained quantitative surface deformation values were integrated with qualitative surface damage interpretation results, followed by a yearly analysis of the overlying rock movement in accordance with the underground coal mining process. The results show that from 2007 to 2021, corresponding surface deformation and damage occurred following mining progress. However, the room and pillar goaf areas had not undergone any surface deformation, nor had there been incidents of landslides or ground fissures; therefore, it was speculated that no roof collapse had occurred in this region. The surface deformation and damage associated with underground coal mining are complex and influenced by the coal seam occurrence, mining methods, strata lithology, terrain slope, temporal evolution, and anthropogenic modifications. These phenomena are representative of the coal mining area, and this methodology can provide a reference for similar endeavors.},

	abstract = {With the gradual expansion of mining scale in open-pit coal mines, slope safety problems are increasingly diversified and complicated. In order to reduce the potential loss caused by slope sliding and reduce the major threat to the safety of life and property of residents in the mining area, this study selected two mining areas in Xinjiang as cases and focused on the relationship between phase noise and deformation. The study predicts the specific time point of slope sliding by analyzing the dynamic history correlation tangent angle between the two. Firstly, the time series data of the micro-variation monitoring radar are used to obtain the small deformation of the study area by differential InSAR (D-InSAR), and the phase noise is extracted from the radar echo in the sequence data. Then, the volume of the deformation body is calculated by analyzing the small deformation at each time point, and the standard deviation of the phase noise is calculated accordingly. Finally, the sliding time of the deformation body is predicted by combining the tangent angle of the ratio of the volume of the deformation body to the standard deviation of the phase noise. The results show that the maximum deformation rates of the deformation bodies in the studied mining areas reach 10.1 mm/h and 6.65 mm/h, respectively, and the maximum deformation volumes are 2,619,521.74 mm3 and 2,503,794.206 mm3, respectively. The predicted landslide time is earlier than the actual landslide time, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. This prediction method can effectively identify the upcoming sliding events and the characteristics of the slope, provide more accurate and reliable prediction results for the slope monitoring staff, and significantly improve the efficiency of slope monitoring and early warning.},

	abstract = {Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques are important for landslide detection and monitoring; however, several limitations and uncertainties, such as the unique north–south flying direction and side-look radar observing geometry, currently limit the ability of InSAR to credibly detect landslides, especially those related to high and steep slopes. Here, we conducted experimental and statistical analysis on the feasibility of time-series InSAR monitoring for steep slopes using ascending and descending SAR images. First, the theoretical (TGNSS), practical (PGNSS), and terrain (Hterrain) (T-P-H) indices for sensitivity evaluations of the slope displacement monitoring results from time-series InSAR were proposed for slope monitoring. Subsequently, two experimental and statistical studies were conducted for the cases with and without Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) monitoring data. Our experimental results of two high and steep open-pit mines showed that the defined theoretical and practical sensitivity indices can quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of ascending and descending InSAR observations in steep-slope deformation monitoring with GNSS data, and the terrain sensitivity index can qualitatively evaluate the feasibility of landslide monitoring results from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 satellite data without GNSS data. We further demonstrate the generalizability of these proposed indices using four landslide cases with both public GNSS and InSAR monitoring data and 119 landslide cases with only InSAR monitoring data. The statistical results indicated that greater indices correlated with higher reliability of the monitoring results, suggesting that these novel indices have wide suitability and applicability. This study can help to improve the practice of slope deformation monitoring using spaceborne InSAR, especially for high and steep slopes.},

	abstract = {Lithium mining has become a controversial issue in the transition to green technologies due to the intervention in natural basins that impact the native flora and fauna in these environments. Large resources of this element are concentrated in Andean salt flats in South America, where extraction is much easier than in other geological configurations. The Pozuelos highland salt flat, located in northern Argentina (Salta’s Province), was chosen for this study due to the presence of different evaporitic crusts and its proven economic potential in lithium-rich brines. A comprehensive analysis of a 5.5-year-long time series of its microwave backscatter with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images yielded significant insights into the dynamics of their crusts. During a field campaign conducted near the acquisition of three SAR images (Sentinel-1, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and SAOCOM-1), field measurements were collected for computational modeling of the SAR response. The temporal backscattering coefficients for the crusts in the salt flat are directly linked to rainfall events, where changes in surface roughness, soil moisture, and water table depth represent the most critical variables. Field parameters were employed to model the backscattering response of the salt flat using the Small Slope Approximation (SSA) model. Salt concentration of the subsurface brine and the water table depth over the slightly to moderately roughed crusts were quantitatively derived from Bayesian inference of the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and SAOCOM-1 SAR backscattering coefficient data. The results demonstrated the potential for subsurface estimation with L-band dual-polarization images, constrained to crusts compatible with the feasibility range of the layered model.},

	abstract = {Ground-Based SAR Interferometry (GB-InSAR) is nowadays a proven technique widely used for slope monitoring in open pit mines and landslide control. Traditional GB-InSAR techniques involve transmitting and receiving antennas moving on a scanner to achieve the desired synthetic aperture. Mechanical movement limits the acquisition speed of the SAR image. There is a need for faster acquisition time as it plays an important role in correcting rapidly varying atmospheric effects. Also, a fast imaging radar can extend the applications to the measurement of vibrations of large structures. Furthermore, the mechanical assembly put constraints on the transportability and weight of the system. To overcome these limitations an electronically switched array would be preferable, which however faces enormous technological and cost difficulties associated to the large number of array elements needed. Imaging Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radars can be used as a significant alternative to usual mechanical SAR and full array systems. This paper describes the ground-based X-band MIMO radar SPARX recently developed by IDS GeoRadar in order to overcome the limits of IDS GeoRadar’s well-established ground based interferometric SAR systems. The SPARX array consists of 16 transmit and 16 receive antennas, organized in independent sub-modules and geometrically arranged in order to synthesize an equally spaced virtual array of 256 elements.},

            Impending catastrophic failure of granular earth slopes manifests distinct kinematic patterns in space and time. While risk assessments of slope failure hazards have routinely relied on the monitoring of ground motion, such precursory failure patterns remain poorly understood. A key challenge is the multiplicity of spatiotemporal scales and dynamical regimes. In particular, there exist a precursory failure regime where two mesoscale mechanisms coevolve, namely, the preferred transmission paths for force and damage. Despite extensive studies, a formulation which can address their coevolution not just in laboratory tests but also in large, uncontrolled field environments has proved elusive. Here we address this problem by developing a slope stability analytics framework which uses network flow theory and mesoscience to model this coevolution and predict emergent kinematic clusters solely from surface ground motion data. We test this framework on four data sets: one at the laboratory scale using individual grain displacement data; three at the field scale using line-of-sight displacement of a slope surface, from ground-based radar in two mines and from space-borne radar for the 2017 Xinmo landslide. The dynamics of the kinematic clusters deliver an early prediction of the geometry, location and time of failure.},

	abstract = {Liupanshui City in Guizhou Province represents a karst mountainous region with a delicate geological environment. The area has a long history of coal mining, and several coal mines have been progressively closed in recent years. However, even after closure of coal mines, the fractured rock mass in the mined-out areas continues to undergo deformation over a specific period. In karst mountainous regions, this deformation is affected by various factors including elevation, slope, precipitation, and vegetation. In this study, we employed SBAS-InSAR technology to construct a time series of surface deformation data from January 2019 to May 2022 within Liupanshui City’s LuJiaZhai-DaPingDi Minefield. Subsequently, this data was comprehensively analyzed in conjunction with time series vegetation cover, monthly precipitation, elevation, and slope data from the identical period. The key findings of this research are as follows: 1) After the closure of the mine, the subsidence area gradually stabilized, yet the volume of subsidence continues to increase. The subsidence area primarily occurs near the MaiZiGou Coal Mine air-mining area, which had a relatively short closure time, as well as in higher elevation areas in the southern and eastern parts of the minefield. Specifically, the maximum cumulative subsidence and the subsidence rate during the study period reached −60.3 mm and −21.83 mm/a, respectively. 2) Surface deformation is closely linked to slope, vegetation type, and rainfall, with subsidence rates and amounts noticeably higher during the rainy season than in the dry season. 3) Surface vegetation cover types display varied effects on deformation, with grassland or shrub areas being more sensitive to precipitation than forests. Forests, especially pine and fir, show a delayed subsidence response to rain, typically 2–3 months post-rainy season onset. This inhibitory effect lessens with increasing slope, particularly beyond a 25° threshold, where responsiveness to precipitation and associated subsidence significantly increase. The findings of this study hold substantial scientific implications for the restoration and management of closed mining areas, as well as the prevention of geological hazards in karst complex mountainous regions.},

In order to understand the subsidence pattern in the mountainous mining regions, three mining faces of the Zhangjiamao mining area in the north of Shaanxi province, northwestern China are taken as case study. Firstly, the small baseline subset (SBAS) technology is used to process 12 images obtained in the mining area to investigate the subsidence data from December 2019 to April 2020. The boundary of surface deformation of the mining area interpreted by the SBAS-InSAR technology is inconsistent with the theoretical boundary suggested by coal mine subsidence theories. Especially, there are some areas in which the real subsidence are larger than estimated area. This discrepancy must be corrected as steep slopes near the theoretical boundary may increase the likelihood of landslides. Our research indicates that: (1) The accumulated displacement and the maximum deformation rate reached −120.759 mm and −270.012 mm/yr in the study area, and the subsidence boundary of the three mining faces is revealed; (2) the combination of the predicted boundary and slope stability analysis can effectively identify the landslide region at the edge of subsidence boundary; (3) the field surveys have proved the effectiveness of this method. The mining area subsidence revealed by our research helps to further understand the impact of land subsidence caused by mining in the mountainous areas and provides a practical method to predict subsidence boundaries and the likelihood for landslides.},

The 2D interferograms obtained by GB-InSAR can be integrated with a 3D terrain model to visually and accurately locate deformed areas. The process has been preliminarily realized by geometric mapping assisted by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). However, due to the line-of-sight (LOS) deformation monitoring, shadow and layover often occur in topographically rugged areas, which makes it difficult to distinguish the deformed points on the slope between the ones on the pavement. The extant resampling and interpolation method, which is designed for solving the scale difference between the point cloud and radar pixels, does not consider the local scattering characteristics difference of slope. The scattering difference information of road surface and slope surface in the terrain model is deeply weakened. We propose a differentiated method with integrated GB-InSAR and terrain surface point cloud. Local geometric and scattering characteristics of the slope were extracted, which account for pavement and slope differentiating. The geometric model is based on a GB-InSAR system with linear repeated-pass and the topographic point cloud relative observation geometry. The scattering model is based on k-nearest neighbor (KNN) points in small patches varies as radar micro-wave incident angle changes. Simulation and a field experiment were conducted in an open-pit mine. The results show that the proposed method effectively distinguishes pavement and slope surface deformation and the abnormal area boundary is partially relieved.},

              A destructive landslide occurred in Himmetoğlu village in Göynük District (Bolu, NW Turkey) caused by open-pit coal mining activities. Field observations after the landslide failure and interviews with villagers motivated us to question the possibility of using satellite SAR data to detect precursory signs of failure with regard to deformation velocity. In this study, first, landslide deformations were mapped by applying the digital elevation model (DEM) of Difference (DoD) method using DEMs from aerial photography and UAV data. However, the primary aim was to track deformation velocity as a sign of landslide failure with persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) methods from Sentinel-1A data. For the SBAS, the deformation velocity for ascending and descending orbits varied between − 12 and 39 mm year
              −1
              and between − 24 and 6 mm year
              −1
              , respectively. For the PSI, the deformation velocity for ascending and descending orbits varied between − 16 and 31 mm year
              −1
              and between − 18 and 20 mm year
              −1
              , respectively. PSI and SBAS resulted in sharply changing line-of-sight displacement rates, which were interpreted as slope failure signs, from three months prior to the landslide. In addition, higher deformation velocities were observed in locations closer to landslide crack as expected. Based on our findings, we concluded that SAR interferometric time-series analysis have the makings of being used as a suitable approach in early discerning and avoiding potential slope failures in open-pit mining areas, when it is made carefully by observing the progress in mining activities by considering the other factors such as rainfall and earthquakes.},

Unlike interferometric measurement of wide‐field deformation, atmospheric propagation heterogeneity is not an accuracy‐limiting factor. Although the radar data confirm prior knowledge concerning the landslide, such an application of SAR interferometry appears difficult under normal conditions of observation using current spaceborne radar systems. The study of soil subsidence, however, can be generalized and improves prior knowledge of the displacement field, which has here been modeled assuming elastic deformation in a half‐space from several sources. The two examples help to understand the limits of the interferometric technique.},

	abstract = {Slope failures, subsidence, earthworks, consolidation of waste dumps, and erosion are typical active deformation processes that pose a significant hazard in current and abandoned mining areas, given their considerable potential to produce damage and affect the population at large. This work proves the potential of exploiting space-borne InSAR and airborne LiDAR techniques, combined with data inferred through a simple slope stability geotechnical model, to obtain and update inventory maps of active deformations in mining areas. The proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing the region of Sierra de Cartagena-La Union (Murcia), a mountainous mining area in southeast Spain. Firstly, we processed Sentinel-1 InSAR imagery acquired both in ascending and descending orbits covering the period from October 2016 to November 2021. The obtained ascending and descending deformation velocities were then separately post-processed to semi-automatically generate two active deformation areas (ADA) maps by using ADATool. Subsequently, the PS-InSAR LOS displacements of the ascending and descending tracks were decomposed into vertical and east-west components. Complementarily, open-access, and non-customized LiDAR point clouds were used to analyze surface changes and movements. Furthermore, a slope stability safety factor (SF) map was obtained over the study area adopting a simple infinite slope stability model. Finally, the InSAR-derived maps, the LiDAR-derived map, and the SF map were integrated to update a previously published landslides’ inventory map and to perform a preliminary classification of the different active deformation areas with the support of optical images and a geological map. Complementarily, a level of activity index is defined to state the reliability of the detected ADA. A total of 28, 19, 5, and 12 ADAs were identified through ascending, descending, horizontal, and vertical InSAR datasets, respectively, and 58 ADAs from the LiDAR change detection map. The subsequent preliminary classification of the ADA enabled the identification of eight areas of consolidation of waste dumps, 11 zones in which earthworks were performed, three areas affected by erosion processes, 17 landslides, two mining subsidence zone, seven areas affected by compound processes, and 23 possible false positive ADAs. The results highlight the effectiveness of these two remote sensing techniques (i.e., InSAR and LiDAR) in conjunction with simple geotechnical models and with the support of orthophotos and geological information to update inventory maps of active deformation areas in mining zones.},

	abstract = {Mining activity causes environmental pollution and geological hazards such as ground subsidence or landslide of which continuous monitoring is necessary. In this study, the activity on the Fushun West Open- Pit Mine (FWOPM), one of the largest open-pit coal mines in Asia located in Fushun, Liaoning Province, China, was analyzed by using a time-series Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence dataset. By using the difference between the two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the area, it was possible to confirm that there was a stockpiling activity in the western area of the FWOPM while excavation activity in the eastern area. By using RGB composite images using the yearly-averaged InSAR coherence images, the activity of the mine was confirmed by period, which was confirmed by Google Earth optical images. As a result, it was possible to confirm three landslides and the related activities on the northwest slope and the dumping activity on the west slope of FWOPM.},
