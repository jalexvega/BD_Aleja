	abstract = {Nowadays, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is widely used in heterogeneous fields with aims strictly dependent on the objectives of the application. One of the most common is the exploitation of the interferometric-SAR (InSAR) to measure millimeter movements on the Earth's surface, aiming to monitor failures (e.g., landslides) or to measure the health state of infrastructures (e.g., mining assets, bridges, and buildings). In this article, developing algorithms to detect temporal and spatial changes in the radar targets becomes very important. This article focuses on the temporal change detection framework, proposing a nonparametric coherent change detection (CCD) algorithm called permutational change detection (PCD), a purely statistical algorithm whose core is the permutational test. The PCD estimates the temporal change points (CPs) of a radar target recognizing blocks structure in the coherence matrix, namely, new radar objects. The algorithm has been fine-tuned for small SAR datasets, with the specific aim of prioritizing the analysis of the latest changes. A rigorous mathematical derivation of the algorithm is carried out, explaining how some limits have been addressed. Then, the performance analysis on the simulated data is deeply accomplished, carried out for the stand-alone PCD and the PCD compared with a parametric CCD algorithm based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and with the Omnibus and REACTIV detectors. The comparison with these other algorithms and the stand-alone performance analysis point out the robustness of the PCD in dealing with very noisy environments, even in the case of a single block. Finally, the PCD is validated by processing two Sentinel I data stacks, ascending and descending geometries, of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Upper Silesian coal basin (USCB) in Poland faces significant ground deformation issues resulting from mining activities conducted without backfill, which can persist for years. These activities can cause damage to surface structures and phenomena such as induced seismicity. Ground deformations can be monitored using differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). However, various DInSAR approaches have their own advantages and limitations, particularly regarding accuracy and atmospheric filtering. This is especially important for high-frequency displacement signals associated with seismic activity, which can be filtered out. Therefore, this study aims to assess the detectability of mining-induced seismic events using interferometric techniques, focusing on the USCB area. In this experiment, we tested two InSAR approaches: conventional DInSAR without atmospheric filtering and the small baseline subset (SBAS) approach, where the atmospheric phase screen was estimated and removed using high-pass and low-pass filtering. The results indicate that, in most cases, post-seismic ground displacement is not detectable using both methods. This suggests that mining-related seismic events typically do not cause significant post-seismic ground displacement. Out of the 17 selected seismic events, only two were clearly visible in the DInSAR estimated deformation, while for four other events, some displacement signals could neither be definitively confirmed nor negated. Conversely, only one seismic event was clearly detectable in the SBAS displacement time series, with no evidence of induced tremors found for the other events. DInSAR proved to be more effective in capturing displacement signals compared to SBAS. This could be attributed to the small magnitude of the tremors and, consequently, the small size of the seismic sources. Throughout the investigated period, all registered events had magnitudes less than 4.0. This highlights the challenge of identifying any significant influence of low-magnitude tremors on ground deformation, necessitating further investigations. Moreover, SBAS techniques tend to underestimate mining displacement rates, leading to smoothed deformation estimates, which may render post-seismic effects invisible for events with low magnitudes. However, after an in-depth analysis of the 17 seismic events in the USCB, DInSAR was found to be more effective in capturing displacement signals compared to SBAS. This indicates the need for significant caution when applying atmospheric filtering to high-frequency displacement signals. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Coal mining leads to surface subsidence, landslides, soil erosion and other problems that seriously threaten the life and property safety of residents in mining areas, and it is urgent to obtain mining subsidence information using high-frequency, high-precision and large-scale monitoring methods. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the deformation monitoring of the Datong mining area using Lutan-1 monostatic and bistatic SAR data. Firstly, the latest Lutan-1 bistatic data are used to reconstruct the DSM, and the interferometric calibration method is used to improve the accuracy of the DSM. Then, the surface deformation monitoring of the mining area is implemented by using DInSAR, SBAS-InSAR and Stacking-InSAR with the reconstructed DSM data and Lutan-1 monostatic SAR data. Finally, the deformation monitoring results are compared with the surface deformation results based on the TanDEM data, and both the results are evaluated using the filed leveling data. Taking 20 images covering the Datong mining area as the data sources, the surface deformation results obtained using different InSAR methods in the mining area were quantitatively evaluated and analyzed. The results indicated that: (1) the DSM obtained using the Lutan-1 bistatic SAR data was assessed and demonstrated with the ICESat laser altimetry data an error of 2.8 m, which meets the Chinese 1:50,000 scale DEM cartographic accuracy standard, and the difference analysis with the TanDEM data shows that the terrain changes are mainly distributed in mountainous areas; (2) Due to the improvement in resolution, the registration accuracy of the SAR images and LT-DSM is higher than that of the TanDEM data in the range direction and azimuth direction; (3) Via evaluation with the filed leveling data, it is found that the surface deformation measurement results based on LT-DSM are less affected by terrain, and the accuracy of LT-DSM-SBAS and LT-DSM-DInSAR is improved by 11.5% and 16.3%, respectively, compared with TanDEM-SBAS and TanDEM-DInSAR, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Lutan-1 bistatic and monostatic data for mine deformation monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The need for implementing efficient value-adding tools able to optimise Earth Observation data usage, compels the scientific community to find innovative solutions for the downstream of Earth Observation information. In this paper we present an unsupervised and automated approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to detect patterns of natural or anthropogenic ground deformation from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Time Series. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the Valle d'Aosta region (Northwest Italy) where mass wasting processes frequently occurs, interacting with human activities and infrastructures. The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced allows for retrieving horizontal and vertical Time Series from multi-geometry data fusion of Line-of-Sight (LOS) InSAR measurements. The added benefit of combining ascending/descending InSAR data and interpolating displacements in time at different time steps is here explored prior to data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction through PCA. The retrieved principal components serve as a continuous solution for cluster membership indicators in the K-means clustering method, allowing to define spatially and temporally coherent displacement phenomena. The signal of the ground deformation clusters is then deconstructed into the underlying trend and seasonality components to enhance the interpretability of the classified satellite InSAR features. Using InSAR Time series data spanning 2014–2020, the proposed approach detects several slope movements and anthropogenic deformations with both linear and seasonal displacement behaviours. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of our transferable approach to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems. © 2023},

	abstract = {A destructive landslide occurred in Himmetoğlu village in Göynük District (Bolu, NW Turkey) caused by open-pit coal mining activities. Field observations after the landslide failure and interviews with villagers motivated us to question the possibility of using satellite SAR data to detect precursory signs of failure with regard to deformation velocity. In this study, first, landslide deformations were mapped by applying the digital elevation model (DEM) of Difference (DoD) method using DEMs from aerial photography and UAV data. However, the primary aim was to track deformation velocity as a sign of landslide failure with persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) methods from Sentinel-1A data. For the SBAS, the deformation velocity for ascending and descending orbits varied between − 12 and 39 mm year−1 and between − 24 and 6 mm year−1, respectively. For the PSI, the deformation velocity for ascending and descending orbits varied between − 16 and 31 mm year−1 and between − 18 and 20 mm year−1, respectively. PSI and SBAS resulted in sharply changing line-of-sight displacement rates, which were interpreted as slope failure signs, from three months prior to the landslide. In addition, higher deformation velocities were observed in locations closer to landslide crack as expected. Based on our findings, we concluded that SAR interferometric time-series analysis have the makings of being used as a suitable approach in early discerning and avoiding potential slope failures in open-pit mining areas, when it is made carefully by observing the progress in mining activities by considering the other factors such as rainfall and earthquakes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to determining the disappearance time of deformation increase after the conclusion of mining activity using Knothe's time function and persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR). As a result, a method was proposed for determining a parameter of the function, the time coefficient c, using SAR data. The area of study was a strongly urbanised (city centre) post-mining region within the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), located in central-eastern Europe (Poland), which was characterised by intense hard coal mining that was concluded in 2015. The study analysed ground displacements generated directly after the conclusion of extraction as well as the time after which the rock mass assumes a relatively calm state. The obtained results were validated based on the results of classic geodesic measurements. The average time coefficient c determined by the developed method was 0.84, while the average time coefficient based on classic geodesic measurements was 1.01. So the theoretical disappearance time of deformation increase was, respectively, 5 years and 6 months and 4 years and 7 months. The research revealed that the developed method is helpful in determining the parameter in Knothe's function and enables a more accurate definition of the disappearance time of deformation increase after the conclusion of extraction. This has great significance in the context of safety and the potential limitation of damage generated as a result of the negative influence of underground mining on the ground surface as well as for the spatial planning of post-mining areas. © 2024 The Author(s)},

It is extremely important to identify the early warning signs of these displacements and take the necessary precautions. In this study, free medium-resolution satellite radar images from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) C-band Sentinel-1A satellite and commercial high-resolution satellite radar images (SAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar) from the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt’s (DLR) X-band TerraSAR-X satellite were obtained, and it was attempted to reveal the traceability and adequacy of monitoring of deformations and possible mass displacements in the dump site of an open-pit coal mine. The compatibility of the results obtained from the satellite radar data with two devices of Global Positioning System (GPS) which were installed in the field was evaluated. Furthermore, the velocity results in the Line Of Sight (LOS) direction and vertical deformation velocity results obtained with all three approaches (GPS/Sentinel-1A, GPS/TerraSAR-X, and Sentinel-1A/TerraSAR-X) were compared. It was observed that the results were statistically equal and the directions of movement were similar/compatible. The result of this study showed that deformations at mine sites can be monitored with sufficient accuracy for early warning with free Sentinel-1A satellite data, although the TerraSAR-X satellite offers a higher resolution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Slope instability in reservoir areas is one of the greatest concerns for public and governments worldwide. The long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas after the impoundments remain poorly understood. Among the technologies applied to detecting and monitoring unstable slopes, interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is one of the most effective. However, owing to the slopes in a reservoir suffering from periodic water-level fluctuations, InSAR technology has shortcomings for monitoring unstable slopes with large displacement for a long time. In this study, a post-processing method of InSAR and a practical strategy were proposed to monitor the long-time evolution of the unstable slopes in reservoir areas both spatially and temporally. The strategy can capture the evolution trends of the unstable slopes based on the variations in their deformation areas with reservoir water-level fluctuations for a long time. The case study was carried out in the Xiluodu reservoir area of China. The monitoring data of the unstable slopes before and after reservoir impoundment were extracted from multi-source SAR data, including those from ALOS-1, ENVISAT ASAR, and Sentinel-1. It was found that there were 40 unstable slopes before the reservoir impoundment and 152 unstable slopes after the reservoir impoundment. Of the 152 slopes, 142 slopes (94%) began deforming in the first 3 years after reservoir impoundment, 15 slopes have been experiencing continuous deformation, and 137 slopes underwent intermittent deformation. The areas of 79 slopes (52%) increased during the water-level drawdown periods and decreased during the rising periods. The areas of 22 slopes (14%) demonstrated the opposite trend, and the areas of 51 slopes (34%) increased independently of the water-level fluctuations. In terms of evolution trends in the deformation area, 30% of slopes experienced a decreasing trend, 15% were under a constant deformation trend, and 55% showed an increasing trend. The distribution of the unstable slopes varied from the dam site to the end of the reservoir, and most of them favorited the areas where slope angle and height were 20–35° and 30–300 m, respectively.

	abstract = {Mine landslides are geological disasters with the highest frequency and cause the greatest harm worldwide. This typically causes significant casualties and damage to property. The study of the formation mechanisms and kinematic processes of mine landslides is important for the prevention and control of mine geological disasters and mine production safety. This study examined the “7.26” landslide, which occurred in the West Open-pit Mine of Fushun, China, in 2016, based on detailed investigations, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) monitoring, and numerical simulations. The mechanism of landslide formation was explored, its kinematic process was inverted, and its disaster evolution process was summarized. The results indicate that: (1) For the formation mechanism of the “7.26” landslide, in July 2015, the old sliding mass was reactivated and deformed along the dominant joints in the shale. The following year, owing to continuous rainfall during the rainy season, the sliding surface accelerated its connection. Finally, a rainstorm on 25–26 July 2016, triggered slope instability. (2) The process of continued movement after landslide instability was approximately 250 s. It can be divided into the landslide initiation (0–10 s), collision scraping (10–150 s), and accumulation stages (150–250 s). (3) The entire process of landslide disasters includes four stages. During the weak-deformation stage, the maximum deformation of the sliding mass monitored by InSAR was approximately 50 mm. During the strong deformation stage, the tensile cracks at the rear edge of the landslide continued to expand, and shear outlets at the front edge had already formed. During the instability and failure stages, rainstorms trigger slope instability, leading to landslides. During the sliding accumulation stage, the landslide mass transformed into debris flow along the slope surface and accumulated at the bottom of the pit. This study provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent evaluation, treatment, monitoring, and warning of landslides in the Fushun West Open-pit Mine and other deep excavation open-pit mines. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The emergency response is crucial in preventing and mitigating urban floods. Both remote sensing and social media data offer distinct advantages in large-scale flood monitoring and near-real-time flood monitoring. However, current research lacks a thorough exploration of the application of social media data and remote sensing imagery in the urban flood emergency response. To address this issue, this paper, while extracting disaster information based on social media data, deeply mines the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and dynamic spatial accessibility of rescue points. Furthermore, SAR imagery and social media data for monitoring urban flooding are compared. This study took the Zhengzhou 7.20 urban flood as a case study and created a methodological framework to quickly extract flood disaster information (flood, landslide, and rescue points) using these two types of data; spatiotemporal analysis and random forest classification were also conducted to mine valuable information. Temporally, the study revealed that disaster information did not increase proportionally with the amount of rainfall during the rainfall process. Spatially, specific regions with higher susceptibility to flooding, landslides, and rescue points were identified, such as the central region characterized by low drainage standards and high-density urban areas, as well as the eastern region with low-lying terrain. Moreover, this study examined the spatial accessibility of rescue resources in real flood scenarios and found that their service coverage varied throughout the day during and after the disaster. In addition, social media excelled in high-density urban areas’ flood point extraction, while SAR performed better in monitoring floods at the edges of low-density urban areas and large water bodies, allowing them to complement each other, to a certain extent. The findings of this study provide scientific reference value for the optimal selection of rescue paths and the allocation of resources in the emergency response to urban floods caused by extreme rainstorms. © 2023 by the authors.},

This study investigates the impact of vertical land motion on landslide-prone districts in Himachal Pradesh, India. We employ Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technology to analyse vertical land motion in the region. Utilizing a dataset spanning six years (2017–2023), we provide precise measurements of land movements with millimetre-level accuracy. Our analysis reveals a range of deformation velocities, from −10 mm/year to +5 mm/year, with observed uplift of less than 31 mm and subsidence of up to 60 mm in the study area. These movements are attributed to prolonged wet conditions, illegal land mining, and ecological vulnerability. The findings underscore the necessity of continuous monitoring to mitigate landslide risks in mountainous regions, highlighting the efficacy of PS-InSAR technology in assessing such hazards. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The Lancang River flows through the alpine canyon region of southwest China, an area that has experienced frequent geological disasters over the years. Early monitoring of geological hazards is essential for disaster prevention and mitigation. However, traditional ground monitoring techniques are limited by the complex terrain conditions in high-altitude valley regions. In contrast, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can provide a high-precision, wide-range monitoring of slow rock-slope deformation, making it an effective tool for studying geological hazards. Within the study area, multiple synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1A satellite were collected, and surface deformation was obtained using the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR). The results demonstrate that combining ascending and descending orbit images can be successfully applied to landslide monitoring in complex mountainous areas. Over 30 potential landslides were identified by combining InSAR results with optical images. The Line-Of-Sight (LOS) direction deformation features and their relationship with precipitation were analyzed based on two typical landslides, and two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) deformation decomposition was carried out to reveal its motion characteristics. It was found that the cumulative deformation fluctuation amplitude was higher during the rainy season, and the main movement direction of the landslide was east-west. In addition, based on the spatial distribution and statistical analysis of deformation points along with meteorological data, geological elements, human activities, and topographic conditions, it is inferred that factors such as low vegetation coverage, tectonic movements, human activities, and high-altitude glacier thawing may contribute to the occurrence of disasters. And it was found that areas with high vegetation cover, high rainfall, and snow cover exhibit lower coherence coefficients. This study offers valuable insights for investigating large-scale geological in alpine canyon regions. © 2023.

The most direct cause of land subsidence are complex geological conditions and excessive mining of underground resources.

In this research, the small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) was used to analyse land subsidence of Caofeidian in Bohai Bay, which could monitor the surface deformation velocity and displacement spatiotemporal evolution through the acquired SAR image dataset. A total of 43 sentinel images from January 2019 to December 2021 were used to calculate the time series of surface deformations. The results showed that there was an obvious subsidence deformation in the central and southern parts of Caofeidian, while the abnormal local subsidence was mainly reflected in the northern part. Geological conditions, groundwater exploitation and engineering disturbance were the main influencing factors of land subsidence. Combining the evolution results with the geological conditions, the surface deformation mechanism and subsidence mode in different regions of Caofeidian were concluded. Subsequently, the environmental effects and potential hazards were analysed.

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been effectively used to monitor surface deformation in a mining area with millimeter-level accuracy. On March 27, 2022, a tailings dam failure occurred in Shanxi Province, China, causing significant damage to surrounding houses, woodland, and roads below the tailings pond. We obtained the surface deformation map of the tailings dam before the catastrophic failure using the InSAR time-series method with a full resolution of Sentinel-1 A. This paper employed a GPU-assisted InSAR processing method for 91 Sentinel-1 images in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode acquired from January 8, 2019, to March 17, 2022. The InSAR results show that during the 25 months preceding the tailings dam failure, Dam-II experienced an average cumulative LOS deformation of nearly 80 mm, while Dam-I experienced a significant deformation of more than 140 mm in the LOS direction. The analysis combining the deformation and rainfall results shows that rainfall significantly affects tailings pond deformation. In general, the deformation evolution has a high correlation with the rainfall annually, but the maximum deformation rate occurs with a delay of about one month compared to the peak rainfall. InSAR technology can significantly improve the monitoring capability of tailings dam failure and other landslide disasters, but it is limited by the observation frequency of the satellite. Thus, improving the temporal resolution of SAR data may assist in predicting tailings dam failure times more accurately. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Expanding open-pit mining towards larger mining scales and greater stripping depths increases the potential risks of landslides on high and steep slopes, endangering human life and property. Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately reveal the main controlling factors and identify the key dynamic parameters to understand the formation mechanism and dynamic process of landslides in open-pit mine landslides. On February 22, 2023, a catastrophic landslide occurred at the Xinjing Open-Pit Coal Mine in the Alxa League of Inner Mongolia, resulting in 53 fatalities, 6 injuries, and economic losses of up to 204.3 million RMB. This study analyzed the formation mechanism of the Xinjing landslide based on remote sensing image interpretation, meteorological and seismic data, and geological and hydrological conditions. The results show that the dominant causes are excavation activities and rear-end slag loading, with the disaster formation process including the excavation disturbance, over-mining deformation, and failure and sliding, characterized by the formation of artificial slopes, deformation of high and steep slopes due to over-mining and coal stripping, and failure induced by external disturbance, respectively. In addition, the source location, dynamic evolution, and key kinematic parameters of the landslide were determined based on the seismic signal inversion. The inversion results show that the landslide has a volume of approximately 6.88 × 106 m3, the main sliding process lasts 35 s with a maximum velocity of 13.7 m/s, and the horizontal displacement is 165 m. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Landslides have become a common global concern because of their widespread nature and destructive power. The Gaizi Valley section of the Karakorum Highway is located in an alpine mountainous area with a high degree of geological structure development, steep terrain, and severe regional soil erosion, and landslide disasters occur frequently along this section, which severely affects the smooth flow of traffic through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In this study, 118 views of Sentinel-1 ascending- and descending-orbit data of this highway section are collected, and two time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) methods, distributed scatter InSAR (DS-InSAR) and small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR), are used to jointly determine the surface deformation in this section and identify unstable slopes from 2021 to 2023. Combining these data with data on sites of historical landslide hazards in this section from 1970 to 2020, we constructed 13 disaster-inducing factors affecting the occurrence of landslides as evaluation indices of susceptibility, carried out an evaluation of regional landslide susceptibility, and identified high-susceptibility unstable slopes (i.e., potential landslides). The results show that DS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR have good agreement in terms of deformation distribution and deformation magnitude and that compared with single-orbit data, double-track SAR data can better identify unstable slopes in steep mountainous areas, providing a spatial advantage. The landslide susceptibility results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of the artificial neural network (ANN) model (0.987) is larger than that of the logistic regression (LR) model (0.883) and that the ANN model has a higher classification accuracy than the LR model. A total of 116 unstable slopes were identified in the study, 14 of which were determined to be potential landslides after the landslide susceptibility results were combined with optical images and field surveys. These 14 potential landslides were mapped in detail, and the effects of regional natural disturbances (e.g., snowmelt) and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., mining projects) on the identification of potential landslides using only SAR data were assessed. The results of this research can be directly applied to landslide hazard mitigation and prevention in the Gaizi Valley section of the Karakorum Highway.

	abstract = {The damage caused by surface deformation is substantial and far-reaching. Although multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is commonly used to monitor surface deformation, it remains challenging to rapidly extract surface deformation on a national scale, especially in China, which has an area of approximately 9.6 million km2. We designed a set of robust parallel computing solutions for rapid acquisition of surface deformations throughout China. The 46,904 Sentinel-1 data covering the entire territory of China from 2018 to 2022 were processed, and a surface deformation dataset throughout China (SDDC) for this period was obtained for the first time. We used external GNSS data to evaluate the accurcy. The SDDC provided abundant deformation information that can play an important role in updating the list of geological disasters, assisting in decision-making in urban construction, and strengthening understanding of potential mechanisms. We analyzed a range of applications of this data, including the deformation of urban areas caused by the overexploitation of groundwater, facility construction, and reclamation, melting deformation of frozen soil, as well as landslide, mining, karst surface, earthquake, and reservoir dam deformation, and deformation of major transport infrastructure throughout China. Our work presents a reference for the rapid extraction of surface deformation at the national scale and provides valuable data support for scientific research and engineering applications in many fields. © 2023},

This study conducts a detailed comparative analysis of accuracy of measured ground deformation provided by Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR), Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tilt photogrammetry with respect to levelling measurements. Based on such analysis we propose an integrated approach that combines multiple remote sensing methods to achieve a better global accuracy in the land subsidence monitoring in mining areas. Conducted at the Banji Coal Mine, this study collected subsidence data from April 10, 2021, to June 28, 2022, through D-InSAR, SBAS, and UAV techniques. After segmenting the subsidence basin into distinct zones, we qualitatively assessed each area with UAV-derived 3D models and quantitatively evaluated the precision of all applied techniques, benchmarking against leveling data. Our findings indicate that integrating D-InSAR, SBAS, and UAV technologies significantly enhances monitoring accuracy over any single method, demonstrating their combined effectiveness in different subsidence areas. Consequently, the synergistic integration of D-InSAR, SBAS, and UAV technologies, capitalizing on their complementary strengths, enables the achievement of intuitive, comprehensive, and high-precision monitoring of subsidence basins in mining areas. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Environmental monitoring of mining regions using satellite imagery is crucial for sustainable exploitation and preventing geohazards. Movements due to the failure of the roof in underground coal mining, by migrating upwards and outwards from the seam being mined, could eventually appear as ground deformation. To investigate the matter further, the surface deformation that occurred over the Pabdana mining area was monitored in three time periods, between October 2, 2014, and July 27, 2019. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) was used based on 150 ascending and descending Sentinel-1A images. The maximum mining subsidence rate during the studied periods was about 30 to 35 mm/yr. The PSI analysis shows that the subsidence rate varied both temporally and spatially during the three studied periods. The time series and the displacement rate for various cross-sections highlight a clear quantitative relationship between coal extraction progress and subsidence, which proceeded southward throughout the three study periods. So, considering coal mining subsidence as a geohazard, land developments and structures over the mining area may be safeguarded. The approach used in this investigation can be implemented in other similar coal mining zones. © 2023 International Union of Geological Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ground surface deformation must be monitored to understand and prevent geological hazards. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology has been widely used in deformation monitoring; however, current GNSS station layout strategies are often subjective and lack theoretical guidance. Therefore, in this study, a GNSS deformation observation network optimization method was developed based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) prior to deformation assistance. This method considers the deformation distribution, cost, accuracy, topography, and actual monitoring requirements and uses kriging interpolation and multiscale iterative optimization to obtain the reference number, spatial distribution, and deformation capture accuracy of GNSS stations in areas experiencing deformation. Simulation experiments showed that the proposed method strengthened the spatial deformation monitoring ability of GNSS by 46%–68% compared with the traditional station layout methods, which ignore the distribution of the deformation. Then, based on the small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR technology and applying the new method, we evaluated the number and location of the most suitable GNSS stations for a mining area and found that 89.6% of the error was less than 1.5 cm, which further illustrates the practicability and reliability of the proposed method. This method provides an effective supplement to station layouts for monitoring GNSS deformation. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The current three-dimensional (3D) deformation monitoring methods, based on the single line-of-sight (LOS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology, are constructed by combining the deformation characteristics of mining subsidence basins, which are incompletely suitable in the edge area of the subsidence basin and some large deformation gradient mines with surface uplift in the LOS direction.The 3D deformation monitoring method of InSAR combined with the surface displacement vector depression angle model (InSAR+ depression angle model) is proposed to obtain more detailed and accurate deformation information of the entire basin. This method first establishes a surface displacement vector depression angle model based on the probability integral method (PIM). The magnitude of the surface displacement vector—owing to the spatial relationship between the LOS direction and the surface displacement vector—is obtained because the horizontal movement direction field and the displacement vector depression angle field of the mining area determine the 3D directions of the surface displacement vector. Then, the PIM model is used to obtain the settlement information of the central area with a large deformation gradient. A complete subsidence basin of the mining area is received by combining the proposed method and the PIM. A total of 35 Sentinel-1A data from 31 March 2018 to 13 May 2019 and the leveling data were used to apply and analyze the accuracy of this method. The experimental results show that this method can obtain more accurate information on surface subsidence around the mining area. Moreover, the overall settlement is more consistent with the actual situation, and the monitoring ability is significantly improved compared with the InSAR and PIM. © 2023 by the authors.},

Traditional deep learning semantic segmentation algorithms encounter difficulties in handling multi-source data. In response to this challenge, we have refined the single-channel encoder-decoder architecture to better discern features derived from multiple sources. We introduce multi-source semantic segmentation with channel and spatial attention fusion (MSSCSAF-Net), a novel solution for semantic segmentation. MSSCSAF-Net incorporates a multi-source encoder (MSE) designed to extract features from diverse inputs. This technique involves the addition of a multi-source channel spatial attention fusion module (MSCSAFM) to fuse the extracted features and a decoder channel spatial attention fusion module (DCSAFM) to improve the fusion with attention of spatial and abstract features.

On the other hand, the long-term overexploitation of groundwater since the last century has led to severe ground subsidence in the same area. We apply the intensity information of Sentinel-1 SAR images to extract the large-scale flood inundation area and their phase information to measure the ground deformation. Since heavy precipitations can recharge groundwater, the relationship between flood inundation, groundwater level change, and ground deformation is analyzed. The results show that the flood inundation areas are mainly distributed along the major rivers due to river overflowing, while heavy precipitation led to the rise of groundwater levels, and there was a significant amount of subsidence mitigation and surface uplift across the region due to the groundwater recovery. This study demonstrates the contribution of radar remote sensing to analyze the mechanism of groundwater recharge and subsidence mitigation benefited by rainstorm events and provides a technical reference to similar circumstances.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Numerous open-pit mines are scattered within the southern mountainous areas of China. Due to the complex mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall, surface disturbances caused by open-pit mining activities pose a serious risk of landslides. To identify potential landslide hazards in mountainous open-pit mining areas in advance, this study proposes a quantitative method that utilizes ascending and descending orbit Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to accurately identify landslide hazards. We select the Xiaolongtan coal mining area in Yunnan, China, as a case study. Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology was employed to obtain the Line of Sight (LOS) deformation of ascending and descending orbits from November 2019 to November 2021. Following this, two-dimensional deformations were calculated based on the obtained LOS deformations. Multiple remote sensing data sources, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), were utilized to extract potential landslide points based on vertical deformation. A combined subjective and objective weighting method was then used to assess the landslide hazard in the study area, and an information quantity model was constructed for landslide hazards in the mining area. Finally, based on high-resolution remote sensing images from the study period, potential landslide hazards were identified in the study area. The results reveal that the vertical deformation rate in the mining area ranges from − 231.73 to 81.42 mm/year, indicating significant subsidence and uplift tendencies. A total of 2353 potential landslide points were identified, primarily located near the slopes of two open-pit mines and in areas with low vegetation coverage. The Xiaolongtan and Buzhaoba open-pit mines, along with the surrounding regions in the study area, were identified to exhibit relatively high landslide hazards. Among the three coal mine waste dumps, the Beipingba waste dump presents a higher landslide hazard. This study provides a scientific basis and practical reference for identifying landslide hazards in mountainous open-pit mining areas. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {With the gradual expansion of mining scale in open-pit coal mines, slope safety problems are increasingly diversified and complicated. In order to reduce the potential loss caused by slope sliding and reduce the major threat to the safety of life and property of residents in the mining area, this study selected two mining areas in Xinjiang as cases and focused on the relationship between phase noise and deformation. The study predicts the specific time point of slope sliding by analyzing the dynamic history correlation tangent angle between the two. Firstly, the time series data of the micro-variation monitoring radar are used to obtain the small deformation of the study area by differential InSAR (D-InSAR), and the phase noise is extracted from the radar echo in the sequence data. Then, the volume of the deformation body is calculated by analyzing the small deformation at each time point, and the standard deviation of the phase noise is calculated accordingly. Finally, the sliding time of the deformation body is predicted by combining the tangent angle of the ratio of the volume of the deformation body to the standard deviation of the phase noise. The results show that the maximum deformation rates of the deformation bodies in the studied mining areas reach 10.1 mm/h and 6.65 mm/h, respectively, and the maximum deformation volumes are 2,619,521.74 mm3 and 2,503,794.206 mm3, respectively. The predicted landslide time is earlier than the actual landslide time, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. This prediction method can effectively identify the upcoming sliding events and the characteristics of the slope, provide more accurate and reliable prediction results for the slope monitoring staff, and significantly improve the efficiency of slope monitoring and early warning. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We provide a map of subsidence caused by underground mining in Upper Silesia, which hosts the largest coal basin in Poland. The map combines data obtained using two InSAR processing techniques and differential LIDAR data. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and Differential SAR Interferometry techniques were applied on images from the Sentinel-1 satellite covering a six-year period from 2015 to 2020. As a result, 132 subsidence areas affected by deformation of >5 mm/year covering 430 km2 were determined. Additionally, a differential LIDAR model covering the period 2012–2021 was an a lyzed, where 103 subsidence areas were identified, of a total area of 88 km2 and where the largest recorded deformation value exceeded 10 m. Despite the large time difference between the two subsidence datasets, good correlation of the data regarding the location and shape of the troughs was observed. However, comparison of InSAR and LIDAR data showed a large under - estimation by DInSAR of values of subsidence in the central parts of the basins. We show the potential of Sentinel-1 and LIDAR data to determine displacements taking place over large areas and over long periods, as a supplement to traditional measurement methods. © 2024, Polish Geological Institute.

	abstract = {The study links multiple natural resource extraction activities in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) with observations of ground deformation. Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired as early as 2015 were used to compute deformation maps and ground deformation time series. Ground deformation produced by induced earthquakes (2015 Mw 4.6 in British Columbia and 2022/23 Mw 5.1/4.6 in Alberta; and 2017/18 Mw 5.0/4.2 slow slip events in British Columbia) were mapped with individual interferograms. Long-lasting ground deformation due to Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) enhanced oil recovery and coal and potash underground mining were mapped with the Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) time series method. When both ascending and descending data were available, MSBAS was used to compute two-dimensional (2D) deformation time series and rates. It was observed that seismic and aseismic ground deformation due to hydraulic fracturing and saltwater injection in WCSB had a similar surface expression (paired anomaly), spatial extent (5-10 km) and orientation (striking NW-SE), suggesting that triggering processes might be technogenic. In the case of hydraulic fracturing, ground deformation appeared soon after the beginning of the operation, while not with saltwater injection, as it took years. The source mechanism of the 2015 Mw 4.6 earthquake was obtained through inverse modelling of the two descending interferograms. The rectangular source model corresponded to a fault at 1.98 ± 0.09 km depth, with 126° ± 7° strike, 14° ± 2° dip, 72° ± 7° rake, 1.61 ± 0.24 km width, 2.54 ± 0.23 km length, and 0.19 ± 0.07 m slip. In the case of in-situ enhanced oil recovery, ground deformation varied significantly depending on the technique. Continuous uplift observed at the SAGD site had a rate of only about 0.05 m/year, while reversible uplift and subsidence at CSS sites exceeded 0.2 m/month, even though wells in both cases were located at approximately similar depths (380 m for SAGD vs 520 m for CSS). In the case of underground mining, the spatial extent of subsidence depended on the extraction depth (200-500 m for coal vs 1000 m for potash). When a mining operation was conducted in an area with topographic relief, horizontal deformation was observed in addition to subsidence. Various observed deformation signals may precede more consequential deformation events. © 2024},

	abstract = {The extraction of underground minerals in hilly regions is highly susceptible to landslides, which requires the application of InSAR techniques to monitor the surface displacement. However, repeated mining for multiple coal seams can cause a large displacement beyond the detectable gradient of the traditional InSAR technique, making it difficult to explore the relationship between landslides and subsurface excavations in both temporal and spatial domains. In this study, the Tengqing landslide in Shuicheng, Guizhou, China, was chosen as the study area. Firstly, the large-gradient surface displacement in the line of sight was obtained by the fusion of SAR offset tracking and interferometric phase. Subsequently, a multi-segment logistic model was proposed to simulate the temporal effect induced by repeated mining activities. Next, a simplified probability integral method (SPIM) was utilized to invert the geometry of the mining tunnel and separate the displacement of the mining subsidence and landslide. Finally, the subsurface mining parameters and in situ investigation were carried out to assess the impact of mining and precipitation on the kinematic process of Tengqing landslides. Results showed that the repeated mining activities in Tengqing can not only cause land subsidence and rock avalanches at the top of the mountain, but also accelerate the landslide displacement. The technical approach presented in this study can provide new insights for monitoring and modeling the effects of repeated mining-induced landslides in mountainous areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Underground mining under the slope can induce strata movement, which in turn can induce landslides and surface subsidence. Previous studies have focused on the damage behavior of the surrounding rock mass caused by underground mining, ignoring the combined effect on the rock mass from open-pit mining to underground mining. In this paper, unmanned aerial photogrammetry (UAV) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) investigations were used to obtain the failure characteristics and displacement evolution of rock masses caused by underground mining. Then, based on Yanqianshan mine measurement results and combined with 3D numerical modeling, the sliding surface evolution inside the slope and the failure mechanism were analyzed. In addition, a double-sliding surface deflection (DSD) failure model for analyzing the landslide area was proposed and validated by base friction tests. The results showed that underground mining was the factor that directly led to landslide development. The failure characteristics are summarized into three phases: bottom collapse, traction landslide, and ground subsidence. The maximum deformation value reaches 193.1 cm, and vertical displacement is dominant with a maximum rate of − 115.73 cm/a. The internal movement boundary was deflected near the slope surface, and the deflection direction depended on the synthesis vector of two mining influences. These results are significant for disaster risk reduction caused by underground mining. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The characterization of landslides located in remote areas poses significant challenges due to the costs of reaching the sites and the lack of reliable subsurface data to constrain geological interpretations. In this paper, the advantages of combining field and remote sensing techniques to investigate the deformation and stability of rock slopes are demonstrated. The characterization of the Fels landslide, a large, slowly deforming rock slope in central Alaska, is described. Historical aerial imagery is used to highlight the relationship between glacier retreat and developing instability. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) datasets are used to investigate the structural geological setting of the landslide, revealing a good agreement between structural discontinuities at the outcrop and slope scales. The magnitude, plunge, and direction of slope surface displacements and their changes over time are studied using a multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar speckle-tracking (SAR ST) dataset. The analyses show an increase in displacement rates (i.e., an acceleration of the movement) between 2010 and 2020. Significant spatial variations of displacement direction and plunge are noted and correlated with the morphology of the failure surface reconstructed using the vector inclination method (VIM). In particular, steeper displacement vectors were reconstructed in the upper slope, compared to the central part, thus suggesting a change in basal surface morphology, which is largely controlled by rock mass foliation. Through this analytical approach, the Fels landslide is shown to be a slow-moving, compound rockslide, the displacement of which is controlled by structural geological features and promoted by glacier retreat. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Excavation and material stockpiling activities in the mining process cause a change in the distribution of forces and stresses in the material. As a result, the material will seek a new equilibrium by releasing the load through a landslide. As part of mitigation, it is necessary to monitor displacements occurring on slopes using high-accuracy devices. Ground-based radar is a technique considered to have good ability to detect displacements in real-time. However, ground-based radar has a weakness in that it cannot detect vertical displacement. One of the emerging technologies that is used for monitoring vertical displacements as LoS displacements is D-InSAR analysis. With the integration of both methods, displacements that occur horizontally and vertically on a slope can be detected properly. In addition, the decrease in rock mass strength due to displacement can be predicted based on numerical analysis using the finite element method. Monitoring was carried out from December 10th, 2021 to April 9th, 2022. The monitoring results from the beginning to the end of the period showed that the horizontal and vertical displacements that occurred in the low wall area were 1247.34 mm and 292.5 mm, respectively. Correlated with these conditions, the Young’s modulus value of the rock mass decreased between 3% and 35%. © 2023 Published by IRCS-ITB.},

CO2 injection into oil reservoirs is an established technology, these reservoirs not only offer the potential for high storage of CO2 but this process could also target a large amount of oil and gas recovery through a technique called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The main objective of this research was to evaluate the storage potential of CO2 in the depleted oil field while also investigating the effect of CO2 injection on reservoir pressure maintenance, and additional oil and gas recovery, in the same field. This paper presented the model of CO2 flooding based on the CO2 displacement mechanism with different scenarios of natural depletion, CO2 injection, and water injection simulated by the ECLIPSE 300 reservoir simulator, and the results of different scenarios were compared. Results of this study showed the site selected for CO2 injection has the potential to store more than 9 billion cubic feet (BCF) of CO2 in each case and witnessed improved gas recovery, while also having a major effect on reservoir pressure maintenance where pressure increased from 2120 psi to 6584 psi. The finding of this work ought to help in preparing for future improvement in underground geological sequestration of CO2 in depleted fields with the same field specifications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The acquisition of precise deformation data, including the entirety of the subsidence basin resulting from subterranean mining operations, assumes critical significance in the context of surface impairment monitoring during the course of mining activities. In light of the constraints associated with InSAR technology when applied to the surveillance of expansive deformation gradient mining regions, an innovative approach is advanced herein for InSAR deformation phase retrieval. This approach integrates a reference phase, derivable through a variety of means, including pre-existing models or measurements. Initially, the reference deformation phase is subjected to subtraction from the wrapped InSAR deformation phase, culminating in the derivation of the wrapped phase indicative of the residual phase. Notably, it is posited that the fringe density characterizing the wrapped phase of the residual phase is theoretically diminished in comparison to that of the InSAR wrapped phase. This reduction in complexity in phase unwrapping ensues as a direct consequence. Subsequent to this, the phase retrieval process is effectuated through the summation of the reference phase and the unwrapped phase pertaining to the residual phase. The study harnesses Sentinel-1A and ALOS PALSAR-2 data, employing the PIM-predicted outcomes and GNSS-RTK monitoring outcomes as reference phases for the execution of phase retrieval experiments in two designated study areas. The computation of subsidence is subsequently realized through the combination of the displacement vector depression angle model and the retrieved phase, with the accuracy thereof corroborated through the utilization of leveling data. The experimental findings underscore the efficacy of the reference phase retrieval methodology in securing a more precise deformation phase characterization within expansive deformation gradient mining regions, thereby demonstrating the suitability of this methodological approach. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {SBAS-InSAR technology is effective in obtaining surface deformation information and is widely used in monitoring landslides and mining subsidence. However, SBAS-InSAR technology is susceptible to various errors, including atmospheric, orbital, and phase unwrapping errors. These multiple errors pose significant challenges to precise deformation monitoring over large areas. This paper examines the spatial characteristics of these errors and introduces a spatially constrained SBAS-InSAR method, termed SSBAS-InSAR, which enhances the accuracy of wide-area surface deformation monitoring. The method employs multiple stable ground points to create a control network that limits the propagation of multiple types of errors in the interferometric unwrapped data, thereby reducing the impact of long-wavelength signals on local deformation measurements. The proposed method was applied to Sentinel-1 data from parts of Jining, China. The results indicate that, compared to the traditional SBAS-InSAR method, the SSBAS-InSAR method significantly reduced phase closure errors, deformation rate standard deviations, and phase residues, improved temporal coherence, and provided a clearer representation of deformation in time-series curves. This is crucial for studying surface deformation trends and patterns and for preventing related disasters. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The longwall retreat and creep displacements are two important parameters for the safety production in underground coal-mine. At present, the problem restricting the displacements measurement of longwall retreat and creep is mainly the influence of coal dust and water vapor at the end of longwall face. Therefore, this paper introduces UWB radar imaging method with strong imaging capability all day and all weather to measure the longwall retreat and creep displacements. That is, the radar moves along the slide-way mounted on the head of armored face conveyor (AFC) to scan the bolt plates fixed in the roadway. Two images obtained before and after the longwall face movement are matched to acquire displacements. The data processing has two steps: radar imaging and image registration. First, according to the signal model of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the modified range-doppler (RD) algorithm with the fourth-order range model is derived to obtain near-field high-resolution image. Second, on the basis of SAR-scale invariant feature transform (SARSIFT) algorithm, this paper replaces Gaussian filter (GF) with bilateral filter (BF) to remove the speck noise, and designs an principal component analysis-improved feature matching (PCAIFM) algorithm to eliminate the wrong matching points. Therefore, the proposed image registration algorithm is called BF-SARSIFT-PCAIFM. According to the correct-match pairs, the similarity transformation model is calculated to acquire the information of retreat and creep displacements. The simulation experiment in building corridor and field test in underground coal mine are carried out, and the results show that the measurement errors of these two displacements are less than 10 mm. Note to Practitioners-The sliding up and down of mining equipment along longwall face, called the longwall creep phenomenon, often occurs during the mining processing, which may cause the roof falling accident, affect the overall advancement of longwall face, and so on. In addition, if the measured retreat displacement is larger or smaller than the normal value, the safety risk may arise and the mining efficiency would be reduced. Therefore, the monitoring of longwall retreat and creep displacements is an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes the UWB radar imaging method to measure the retreat and creep displacements. Due to its imaging capacity all-day and all-weather, UWB radar imaging method has the potential for application in underground coal-mine. The experiment results performed in this paper verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. However, because the two-dimensional (2D) radar image has only range and azimuth resolutions and not height, the radar movement route must be in the same horizontal plane as bolt plates to be scanned, which increases the difficulty of practical application. In addition, the scanning mode of radar linear motion is unsuitable for underground limited space. Therefore, UWB radar three-dimensional (3D) imaging method under new scanning mode is the focus of our next research.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There is a critical need for a global monitoring capability for Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs), to help protect the surrounding communities and the environment. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) shows much promise towards this ambition. However, extracting meaningful information and interpreting the deformation patterns from InSAR data can be a challenging task. One approach to address this challenge is through the use of data science techniques. In this study, the representation of InSAR metadata as Entity Embeddings within a Deep Learning framework (EE-DL) is investigated for modelling the spatio-temporal deformation response. Entity embeddings are commonly used in natural-language-processing tasks. They represent discrete objects, such as words, as continuous, low-dimensional vectors that can be manipulated mathematically. We demonstrate that EE-DL can be used to predict anomalous patterns in the InSAR time series. To evaluate the performance of the EE-DL approach in SAR interferometry, we conducted experiments over a mining test site (Cadia, Australia), which has been subject to a TSF failure. This study demonstrated that EE-DL can detect and predict the fine spatial movement patterns that eventually resulted in the failure. We also compared the results with deformation predictions from common baseline models, the Random Forest model and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Both EE-DL and GPR greatly outperform Random Forest. While GPR is also able to predict displacement patterns with millimetric accuracy, it detects a significantly lower number of anomalies compared to EE-DL. Overall, our study showed that EE-DL is a promising approach for building early-warning systems for critical infrastructures that use InSAR to predict ground deformations. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Over the course of several decades, subsidence has exerted a notable impact on the mining sector. The preponderance of subsidence occurrences is evident within coal mines. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have emerged as principal instruments for the evaluation and characterization of subsidence phenomena. The manifestation of mining-induced subsidence engenders concerns encompassing roof collapse, infrastructural damage, and the formidable challenge of preserving human lives. The repercussions of mining-related subsidence extend to indigenous flora and subterranean water reservoirs. This phenomenon critically impedes the sustainable advancement of mining zones, precipitates the depletion of natural reservoirs, and engenders a host of ecological and environmental predicaments that cast an adverse influence on socio-economic dynamics. Within mining contexts, subsidence manifests as both vertical and horizontal ground displacement, presenting as fissures, depressions, troughs, and sinkholes. The present article furnishes a comparative discourse on diverse methodologies harnessed for the assessment of mining-induced subsidence. The scholarly community has employed a repertoire of eight predominant techniques, as delineated in the conclusive remarks of this study. Over the bygone two decades, considerable strides have been taken, enabling the deployment of sophisticated paradigms, such as remote sensing and GIS, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DiNSAR), for the identification and quantification of land subsidence phenomena. © 2023, Books and Journals Private Ltd..

	abstract = {Nonlinear deformation is a dynamically changing pattern of multiple surface deformations caused by groundwater overexploitation, underground coal mining, landslides, urban construction, etc., which are often accompanied by severe damage to surface structures or lead to major geological disasters; therefore, the high-precision monitoring and prediction of nonlinear surface deformation is significant. Traditional deep learning methods encounter challenges such as long-term dependencies or difficulty capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns when predicting nonlinear deformations. In this study, we developed a dual-attention-mechanism CNN-LSTM network model (DACLnet) to monitor and accurately predict nonlinear surface deformations precisely. Using advanced time series InSAR results as input, the DACLnet integrates the spatial feature extraction capability of a convolutional neural network (CNN), the advantages of the time series learning of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the enhanced focusing effect of the dual-attention mechanism on crucial information, significantly improving the prediction accuracy of nonlinear surface deformations. The groundwater overexploitation area of the Turpan Basin, China, is selected to test the nonlinear deformation prediction effect of the proposed DACLnet. The results demonstrate that the DACLnet accurately captures developmental trends in historical surface deformations and effectively predicts surface deformations for the next two months in the study area. Compared to traditional LSTM and CNN-LSTM methods, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the DACLnet improved by 85.09% and 68.57%, respectively. These research results can provide crucial technical support for the early warning and prevention of geological disasters and can serve as an effective alternative tool for short-term ground subsidence prediction in areas lacking hydrogeological and other related data. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Dump sites with broken overburden layers in surface mines have the risk of instability due to their loose bulk structures. In this study, deformations at a dump site of the Kangal/Kalburçayırı open-pit coal mine and their long-term behaviours were revealed with InSAR data for a total period of 4.5 years. Firstly, 9-periods involving different time ranges were created considering the presence of LiCSAR products. Then, the deformation velocities of each period were calculated by LiCSBAS software using LiCSAR products. The area where high deformations were concentrated from the LiCSBAS result products was determined and divided into 4 zones for more detailed evaluations. At the final stage, the period-deformation velocity graphs were drawn separately for each zone with the data obtained using two different approaches from the deformation velocities of all periods, and long-term deformation behaviours were determined. More reliable future behaviour projections could be made considering the current increasing or decreasing trend of deformation behaviours. It was revealed that vertical deformations at the dump site had an increasing trend in the first periods and a decreasing trend in the later periods. Maximum vertical deformation velocities ranging between −111.4 mm/year and −178.0 mm/year in the first 4 months reached the highest values (ranging from −141.9 mm/year to −261.8 mm/year) at the end of two years and decreased to values ranging from −33.0 mm/year to −44.3 mm/year in the later periods. It was found that horizontal deformation velocities ranged between +0.5 mm/year and +55.4 mm/year in the east–west direction and between −7.0 mm/year and −56.8 mm/year in the west-east direction, were approximately 5 times lower than vertical velocities and did not have a constantly increasing or decreasing trend in any direction. It was observed that deformations exhibited a behaviour resulting from the structural property of the dump bulk material. The results of the evaluations showed that the risk of instability gradually decreased at the dump site. The methodology of this study can enable the determination of similar areas that may pose a threat in a short time, the prioritization of risky areas, the planning of more detailed studies, and taking the necessary measures in a timely manner. © 2023 COSPAR},

Here we show that the ground deformation can be precisely mapped with high density by spaceborne InSAR technique. We proposed a full scatterers InSAR (FS-InSAR) methodology, which can significantly improve the quality of the interferograms by applying a dual-scale temporal low-pass filter (DTLF) to separate both atmospheric and noisy phases from deformation phases, without external atmospheric data. Simulation experiments were conducted to determine the small-scale and large-scale window sizes and evaluate the effectiveness of DTLF. Then we applied the FS-InSAR method to the Tianjin-Tangshan region, China using Sentinel-1 data, assessed the regenerated differential low-frequency phases, and validated the results with leveling measurements and groundwater depth data. What's more, detailed ground deformation was retrieved over the Tangshan mining area with an unprecedented density of 98.55%. Our results demonstrate that the FS-InSAR strategy contrasts sharply with the previous PS-InSAR or DS-InSAR methods by simultaneously solving the two bottleneck problems of atmospheric artifacts and decorrelation in most cases except for water bodies or dense vegetations such as rainforest, thereby it is of great importance for future monitoring and understanding the ground deformation to prevent and control geological disasters. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Introduction: This study aims to differentiate local and regional ground uplift, as well as sub-regional subsidence induced by groundwater level drawdown, which are possibly enhanced across fault structures, as monitored by various synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) processing methods. A buoyant mantle plume under the Eifel may be responsible for the regional ground uplift, including the Weser–Geul (BE) and South Limburg regions (NL), which could negatively affect the area proposed for the future Einstein Telescope. Methods: Different InSAR processing techniques are compared to evaluate their limits in tracking fault structures on a time series of Copernicus Sentinel-1 images while detecting and measuring ground motion based on their phase signature. The results present an overall stable ground for the Euregio Meuse–Rhine region, especially at the Belgian–Dutch border, while tectonic activity is observed along the German side of the Rhine Graben. Results: As the current neotectonic activity in the target area was not well known, we performed a spatiotemporal analysis of ground deformation associated with the presence of NW–SE-trending normal faults where karst also develops, as well as along the Variscan NE–SW-trending thrust faults. This work demonstrates that the identification of deformation hazards using satellite remote sensing (and connected seismological) techniques is challenging mainly due to (very) small regional scale deformation, terrain conditions, and SAR properties. Discussion: Thus, the results mostly indicate ground stability over the area; however, also some agricultural activities were observed, as was deformation along some infrastructure such as railways. Displacements of millimetric order measured along the faults located near the Geul valley (BE) are probably related to old mining activities. Copyright © 2024 Schlögel, Owczarz, Orban and Havenith.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing, particularly satellite-based, can play a valuable role in monitoring areas prone to geohazards. The high spatial and temporal coverage provided by satellite data can be used to reconstruct past events and continuously monitor sensitive areas for potential hazards. This paper presents a range of techniques and methods that were applied for in-depth analysis and utilization of Earth observation data, with a particular emphasis on: (1) detecting mining subsidence, where a novel approach is proposed by combining an improved U-Net model and Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology. The results showed that the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) U-Net model performed better than the U-Net (baseline) model in terms of Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) and Intersection over Union (IoU) indicators; (2) monitoring water conservancy and hydropower engineering. The Xiaolangdi multipurpose dam complex was monitored using Small BAsline Subsets (SBAS) InSAR method on Sentinel-1 time series data and four small regions with high deformation rates were identified on the slope of the reservoir bank on the north side. The dam body also showed obvious deformation with a velocity exceeding 60 mm/a; (3) the evaluation of the potential of InSAR results to integrate monitoring and warning systems for valuable heritage and architectural preservation. The overall outcome of these methods showed that the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in combination with InSAR data leads to more efficient analysis and interpretation, resulting in improved accuracy and prompt identification of potential hazards; and (4) finally, this study also presents a method for detecting landslides in mountainous regions, using optical imagery. The new temporal landslide detection method is evaluated over a 7-year analysis period and unlike conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, this approach does not depend on any prior-knowledge and can potentially detect landslides over extended periods of time such as decades. © 2023 Wuhan University.

	abstract = {The Volta Delta (Ghana, West Africa) is increasingly impacted by Sea Level Rise (SLR). SLR renders the Volta Delta mostly vulnerable to flooding, salinization of water resources and agricultural fields, and permanent loss of lands. This would potentially threaten its population, infrastructure and economy, and could be worsened by land subsidence (LS). Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR) in this study is the rate of LS with respect to SLR. It is thus very important to precisely quantify LS rates together with SLR and plan and assess countermeasures. This study presents and discusses recent LS rates in the Volta Delta derived from satellite-based SAR-Interferometry and their impact on relative SLR. Sentinel-1 scenes acquired between 2015 and 2021 were used to quantify recent LS in the study area. The Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique was applied, which allowed for estimating displacement rates of coherent backscatter targets with mm/yr precision. Separate analyses of time series for the Keta lagoon and Songor lagoon areas of the delta give insight into the vertical land movements, with irregularly distributed average rates of up to 4 mm/yr. LS in the Volta Delta is due to various causes, most prominently natural compaction of young deltaic sediments, but also aquifer over-exploitation and salt mining, and probably increasingly less compensated by a drop in sediment supply due to damming. Furthermore, projection of future elevation projections by RSLR was assessed by combining the observed LS rates with three IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. The RSLR impact assessments computed revealed that by 2100, more than 20% of the Volta Delta districts could potentially be below MSL for all the addressed RCP scenarios, including the fragile but key sand barriers surrounded by water bodies. The study is, however, a preliminary investigation and recommends further local ground-based LS investigations to calibrate PS-InSAR outcome, thus improving our understanding of the areas driving critical present and future changes in the Volta Delta. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Sublevel caving mining causes surface deformation in three distinct zones parallel to the extracted deposit. Most of the published research is focused on the extent of the caved and fracture zones. The extent of the largest, continuous deformation zone and, thus, the influence of the mine on its surroundings is not yet fully documented. This study aimed at assessing the extent of surface deformation caused by the mining of a steep iron ore deposit in Norway. For this purpose, an innovative combination of the permanent scatterer (PS) InSAR technique and line-of-sight (LOS) movement data provided by a public web service and geographic information system (GIS) spatial interpolation methods was proposed. Two ascending tracks’ (A102 and A175) datasets spanning the period of 3 June 2016–11 October 2021 were used. Three interpolation methods, inverse distance weighted (IDW), radial basis function (RBF) and ordinary kriging (OK), were analysed in terms of their performance for mapping continuous deformation. The RBF and OK methods with anisotropy returned the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) values. The obtained difference in the maximum extent of deformation amounted to 26 m for the track A102 dataset and 44.5 m for the track A175 dataset, depending on the interpolation method used. The estimated maximum extent of the continuous deformation zone on the hanging-wall side of the sublevel caving mining operation is 663 m. This corresponds to a limit angle of 38.7 degrees, which is lower than in previously published studies. The results show that the influence of sublevel caving mining on the surroundings can be greater than previously thought. The usefulness of public PSInSAR data available from a national online service and spatial interpolation methods for determining the area of mining terrain deformations has been proven. The proposed approach provides a low-cost alternative and complementation for surveys performed about the mine and it is argued that it should be implemented as part of the mine’s monitoring system. © 2023 by the authors.},

Therefore, the spatial–temporal patterns of ground deformation provide a crucial indicator to understand the mining activities, related geohazards, and environmental restoration. This study investigates the decadal deformation (2012–2022) of three coal mines during different stages of mines’ life cycles in Henan, China, using radar interferometry with Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 data. The results reveal multiple deformation patterns across different areas: the Changcun mine area changed from ground subsidence to uplift following the termination of exploitation in 2016; the Xiadian mine area has been continuously developing over the past decade, resulting in a cumulative subsidence of 55.6 mm; and the Liyuan mine area exhibits surface rebound at a rate of 7.9 mm/year since its closure in 2007. We also probe the mining geometry of the production process by using a rectangular model. This study highlights the significance of long-term InSAR observations and deformation modeling in elucidating the mining operation dynamics of small mining zones in their production, transition, and post-closure periods, thereby facilitating the management of small-scale mining. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {SAR interferometry (InSAR) has emerged in the big-data era, particularly benefitting from the acquisition capability and open-data policy of ESA’s Sentinel-1 SAR mission. A large number of Sentinel-1 SAR images have been acquired and archived, allowing for the generation of thousands of interferograms, covering millions of square kilometers. In such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the derived velocity map. Here, we present a strategy facilitated by the deep learning networks to firstly detect the localized deformation and then carry out the time-series analysis on small interferogram patches with deformation signals. Specifically, we report following-up studies of our proposed deep learning networks for masking decorrelation areas, detecting local deformation, and unwrapping high-gradient phases. In the applications of mining-induced subsidence monitoring and slow-moving landslide detection, the presented strategy not only reduces the computation time, but also avoids the influence of large-scale tropospheric delays and unwrapping errors. The presented detection-first strategy introduces deep learning to the time-series InSAR processing chain and makes the mission of operationally monitoring localized deformation feasible and efficient for the large-scale InSAR. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The collapse of open-pit coal mine slopes is a kind of severe geological hazard that may cause resource waste, economic loss, and casualties. On 22 February 2023, a large-scale collapse occurred at the Xinjing Open-Pit Mine in Inner Mongolia, China, leading to the loss of 53 lives. Thus, monitoring of the slope stability is important for preventing similar potential damage. It is difficult to fully obtain the temporal and spatial information of the whole mining area using conventional ground monitoring technologies. Therefore, in this study, multi-source remote sensing methods, combined with local geological conditions, are employed to monitor the open-pit mine and analyze the causes of the accident. Firstly, based on GF-2 data, remote sensing interpretation methods are used to locate and analyze the collapse area. The results indicate that high-resolution remote sensing can delineate the collapse boundary, supporting the post-disaster rescue. Subsequently, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A satellite data, covering the period from mining to collapse, are integrated with D-InSAR and DS-InSAR technologies to monitor the deformation of both the collapse areas and the potential risk to dump slopes. The D-InSAR result suggests that high-intensity open-pit mining may be the dominant factor affecting deformation. Furthermore, the boundary between the collapse trailing edge and the non-collapse area could be found in the DS-InSAR result. Moreover, various data sources, including DEM and geological data, are combined to analyze the causes and trends of the deformation. The results suggest that the dump slopes are stable. Meanwhile, the deformation trends of the collapse slope indicate that there may be faults or joint surfaces of the collapse trailing edge boundary. The slope angle exceeding the designed value during the mining is the main cause of the collapse. In addition, the thawing of soil moisture caused by the increase in temperature and the reduction in the mechanical properties of the rock and soil due to underground voids and coal fires also contributed to the accident. This study demonstrates that multi-source remote sensing technologies can quickly and accurately identify potential high-risk areas, which is of great significance for pre-disaster warning and post-disaster rescue. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Foreseeing the failure of important unstable volumes is a major concern in the Alps, especially due to the presence of people and infrastructures in the valleys. The use of monitoring and remote sensing techniques is aimed at detecting potential instabilities and the combination of several techniques permits the cross-validation of the detected movements. Supplemented with field mapping and structural analysis, it is possible to define possible scenarios of rupture in terms of volume, mechanisms of failure and susceptibility. A combined observation strategy was applied to the study of major instability located in the Ticinese Alps (Switzerland), Cima del Simano, where the monitoring started in 2006 with the measurement of opened cracks with extensometers. Since 2021, the monitoring has been completed by LiDAR, satellite and GB-InSAR observations and structural analysis. Here, slow but constant movements of about 7 mm/yr were detected along with rockfall activities near the Simano summit. Eight failure scenarios of various sizes ranging from 2.3 × 105 m3 to 51 × 106 m3, various mechanisms (toppling, planar, wedge and circular sliding) and various occurrence probabilities were defined based on the topography and the monitoring results and by applying a Slope Local Base Level (SLBL) algorithm. Weather acquisition campaigns by means of thermologgers were also conducted to suggest possible causes that lead to the observed movements and to suggest the evolution of the instabilities with actual and future climate changes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of mining-induced subsidence dynamics enables to the exploration and analysis of changes in the direction of surface deformation caused by the extraction of underground resources. Both human activities and geological environments affect these changes to a large extent. LuTan-1 (LT-1) satellite as the first SAR mission with L-band bistatic spaceborne in China, provides continuous imagery for analyzing surface deformations through differential SAR interferometry, offering valuable velocity results using stacking techniques. The results of the subsidence bowl obtained from LT-1 closely align with those from Sentinel-1 in the almost same period in Datong, China. Furthermore, we validated the DInSAR results of LT-1 and Sentinel-1 using continuous GNSS data from the corresponding time frames. Notably, we observed a significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of LT-1 datasets due to the in-orbit performance test. Finally, we explored the surface deformation dynamics pertinent to mining activities using DInSAR results obtained from four different time periods. These results revealed substantial changes on the shape and spatial location of the subsidence bowls over time. This indicates a maximum horizontal displacement in the directional change of approximate 1.429 km and an average face advance rate between 0.724 and 6.355 m/day within about a one-year time period. Lastly, velocity and accumulated displacement gradient maps, derived from stacking results, were overlaid to the distribution of critical infrastructures in the study areas to assess their exposure to mining subsidence, and a validation process was carried out using GF-7 optical images. This study emphasizes the potential of LT-1 to monitor mining subsidence dynamics and its capability for joint analysis with the exposure of critical infrastructures. © 2024},

By analyzing geologic and geotechnical data, here we show that the hexagonal surface ejecta is likely not a result of liquefaction. Instead, we propose dissolution cavity collapse (DCC) as an alternative driving mechanism. We support this theory with pre-event Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data, which reveals differential subsidence patterns and the creation of subsurface void space. We also find that DCC is likely triggered at a lower shaking threshold than classical liquefaction. This and other unknown mechanisms can masquerade as liquefaction, introducing bias into liquefaction prediction models that rely on liquefaction inventories.

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, extensive halite extraction in Maceió, Brazil, has resulted in significant geological risks, including ground collapses, sinkholes, and infrastructure damage. These risks became particularly evident in 2018, following an earthquake, which prompted the cessation of mining activities in 2019. This study investigates subsidence deformation resulting from these mining operations, focusing on the collapse of Mine 18 on 10 December 2023. We utilized the Quasi-Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (QPS-InSAR) technique to analyze a dataset of 145 Sentinel-1A images acquired between June 2019 and April 2024. Our approach enabled the analysis of cumulative displacement, the loss of amplitude stability, the evolution of amplitude time series, and the amplitude change matrix of targets near Mine 18. The study introduces an innovative QPS-InSAR approach that integrates phase and amplitude information using amplitude time series to assess the lifecycle of radar scattering targets throughout the monitoring period. This method allows for effective change detection following sudden events, enabling the identification of affected areas. Our findings indicate a maximum cumulative displacement of −1750 mm, with significant amplitude changes detected between late November and early December 2023, coinciding with the mine collapse. This research provides a comprehensive assessment of deformation trends and ground stability in the affected mining areas, providing valuable insights for future monitoring and risk mitigation efforts. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The China Loess Plateau (CLP) is the world’s most extensive and thickest region of loess deposits. The inherently loose structure of loess makes the CLP particularly vulnerable to geohazards such as landslides, collapses, and subsidence, resulting in substantial geological and environmental challenges. Xining City, situated at the northwest edge of the CLP, is especially prone to frequent geological hazards due to intensified human activities and natural forces. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) has become a widely used tool for identifying landslide hazards and displacement monitoring because of its high accuracy, low cost, and wide coverage. In this study, we utilized the small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR technique to derive the line of sight (LOS) displacements of Xining City using Sentinel-1 datasets from ascending and descending orbits between October 2014 and September 2022. By integrating LOS displacements from the two datasets, we retrieved the eastward and vertical displacements to characterize the kinematics of active slopes. To identify the active areas semi-automatically, we applied the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to cluster InSAR measurement points (IMPs). Forty-eight active slopes with areas ranging from 0.0049 to 0.5496 km2 and twenty-five subsidence-dominant areas ranging from 0.023 to 3.123 km2 were identified across Xining City. Kinematics analysis of the Jiujiawan landslide indicated that acceleration started in August 2016, likely triggered by rainfall, and continued until the landslide. The extreme rainfall in August 2022 may have pushed the Jiujiawan landslide beyond its critical threshold, leading to instability. Additionally, the study identified nine active slopes that threaten the normal operation of the Lanzhou–Xinjiang High-Speed Railway, with kinematic analysis suggesting rainfall-related accelerations. The influence of anthropogenic activities on ground displacements in loess areas was also confirmed through time series displacement analysis. Our results can be leveraged for geohazard prevention and management in Xining City. As SAR image data continue to accumulate, InSAR can serve as a regular tool for maintaining up-to-date landslide inventories, thereby contributing to more sustainable geohazard management. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Slope failures frequently occur in open-pit mines, resulting in significant losses. Identifying the precursory displacements and triggering factors for detecting unstable slopes is critical for reducing and preventing their impact. This study proposes combining satellite radar interferometry and infrared thermography with numerical simulation to determine unstable slopes in an open-pit mine. First, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is utilized to capture deformation information in a line-of-sight direction in terms of velocity to locate the long-time movement on a large scale. The application of infrared thermography enables the detection of peculiar features based on the different thermal patterns occurring along the slope and the interpretation of critical sectors matching with the instability zones highlighted by the InSAR. In particular, areas with various surface temperatures were associated with vegetated spots, new benches, bare sectors, and contact between different lithologies. By means of three-dimensional stability analyses, the associated interferometry movement confirmed the slope instability, and a critical failure surface was found using two-dimensional numerical simulation. The efficacy of the proposed approach is verified through a massive slope failure in the Qidashan open-pit mine in Liaoning, China. It predicts the slope failures caused by intense rainfall and reveals the progressive failure mechanism. The practical application has demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach for detecting failure precursors, providing a novel procedure for remotely identifying critical slopes in an open-pit with frequent mining activity.

	abstract = {Many studies deal with the correlation between landslide velocity and damage degree of buildings or infrastructure. For shallow or moderate depth, slow landslides such as complex, slow flow or roto-translation type are well studied by InSAR or other ground-based instruments to retrieve a matrix correlation of velocity damage. However, few of them investigate the effects of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DsGSD) displacement. These phenomena usually have a very deep sliding surface, covering a vast area with constant velocity. This study investigates the building damage, mapped with a detailed field survey, correlated with one of the massive DsGSD of the Alps (Sauze d’Oulx DsGSD, NW Italy) affecting several villages. We used multi-temporal InSAR data and ground-based monitoring to obtain 26 years of displacement time series. The results show a complicated correlation, in which several factors influence the degree of building damage, such as the material of the building, their state of maintenance, the position on DsGSD, the depth of movement, the secondary process or the velocity range variability. A simple correlation with velocity is not exhaustive: the central part of DsGSD shows a higher velocity rate (up to 30 mm/yr), but with limited damage; while at the toe boundary of deformation, slow rate of movement produces more severe damage. These findings show that several in-depth studies should integrate velocity data from monitoring to assess the coexistence of these huge complex phenomena and define their impact on anthropic structures before making a risk assessment and a suitable land use planning of mountainous territory. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Illegal coal mining is prevalent worldwide, leading to extensive ground subsidence and land collapse. It is crucial to define the location and spatial dimensions of these areas for the efficient prevention of the induced hazards. Conventional methods for goaf locating using the InSAR technique are mostly based on the probability integral model (PIM). However, The PIM requires detailed mining information to preset model parameters and does not account for the layered structure of the coal overburden, making it challenging to detect underground goaves in cases of illegal mining. In response, a novel method based on the InSAR technique and the Stratified Optimal Okada Dislocation Model, named S-ODM, is proposed for locating goaves with basic geological information. Firstly, the S-ODM employs a numerical model to establish a nonlinear function between the goaf parameters and InSAR-derived ground deformation. Then, in order to mitigate the influence of nearby mining activities, the goaf azimuth angle is estimated using the textures and trends of the InSAR-derived deformation time series. Finally, the goaf’s dimensions and location are estimated by the genetic algorithm–particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO). The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using both simulation and real data, demonstrating average relative errors of 6.29% and 7.37%, respectively. Compared with the PIM and ODM, the proposed S-ODM shows improvements of 19.48% and 52.46% in geometric parameters. Additionally, the errors introduced by GA-PSO and the influence of ground deformation monitoring errors are discussed in this study. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Open pit coal mining affects surrounding populated areas, resulting in terrain surface deformation. Surface deformation should be monitored as often as possible to control deformations and prevent potential incidents. This paper analyzes time series deformation estimated from the Sentinel-1 satellite images using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry method to monitor subsidence rates caused by open pit mining activities. It is possible to measure deformations using classical geodetic methods, but those are rarely used in practice because they are time-consuming and expensive for application in large areas. Using the open access radar images from the Sentinel-1 mission, 513 images from the repository were downloaded between October 2016 and the end of December 2020. We present the processing steps in detail in order to establish a workflow for the automated processing of vertical displacement estimation using open source tools; a total of 402 images were processed: 215 images belonged to the ascending satellite orbit, 187 images belonged to the descending orbit, and 111 images were rejected because of adverse weather conditions. The PS InSAR technique has never been used for the mines of the Republic of Serbia or for land surveying practices related to deformation monitoring. The results based on the Sentinel-1 images were compared with results from geodetic leveling and with neotectonic uplift trends. The trend lines of vertical displacement obtained from PS and corresponding leveling are significantly similar (a Pearson correlation of 85% with a p-value of 0.015). The final evaluation reported results of vertical displacements at the leveling benchmark of −3.4 mm/year with the PS InSAR method and −2.7 mm/year with the leveling method. A comparison of the PS vertical displacements with a settlement model fits reasonably, suggesting that the measurements are valid. As four years of PS time series data is insufficient to establish undisputable conclusions on the neotectonics uplift, extending the time series (covering at least a decade) implies that this approach will become attractive in future neotectonic uplift trend estimations. This study illustrates not only the ability of Sentinel-1 data in mapping vertical deformations, but the obtained results could also be used for geohazard monitoring and land monitoring in general for the area of interest. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technology is adopted to monitor the Line of Sight (LOS) displacement of Fushun West Opencast Coal Mine (FWOCM) and its surrounding areas in northeast China using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from 2018 to 2022. The spatial-temporal evolution of urban subsidence and the south-slope landslide are both analyzed in detail. Comparison with ground measurements and cross-correlation analysis via cross wavelet transform with monthly precipitation data are also conducted, to analyze the influence factors of displacements in FWOCM. The monitoring results show that a subsidence basin appeared in the urban area near the eastern part of the north slope in 2018, with settlement center located at the intersection of E3000 and fault F1. The Qian Tai Shan (QTS) landslide on the south slope, which experienced rapid sliding during 2014 to 2016, presents seasonal deceleration and acceleration with precipitation, with the maximum displacement in vicinity of the Liushan paleochannel. The results of this paper have fully taken in account for the complications of large topographic relief, geological conditions, spatial distribution and temporal evolution characteristics of surface displacements in opencast mining area.

	abstract = {Slope failures, subsidence, earthworks, consolidation of waste dumps, and erosion are typical active deformation processes that pose a significant hazard in current and abandoned mining areas, given their considerable potential to produce damage and affect the population at large. This work proves the potential of exploiting space-borne InSAR and airborne LiDAR techniques, combined with data inferred through a simple slope stability geotechnical model, to obtain and update inventory maps of active deformations in mining areas. The proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing the region of Sierra de Cartagena-La Union (Murcia), a mountainous mining area in southeast Spain. Firstly, we processed Sentinel-1 InSAR imagery acquired both in ascending and descending orbits covering the period from October 2016 to November 2021. The obtained ascending and descending deformation velocities were then separately post-processed to semi-automatically generate two active deformation areas (ADA) maps by using ADATool. Subsequently, the PS-InSAR LOS displacements of the ascending and descending tracks were decomposed into vertical and east-west components. Complementarily, open-access, and non-customized LiDAR point clouds were used to analyze surface changes and movements. Furthermore, a slope stability safety factor (SF) map was obtained over the study area adopting a simple infinite slope stability model. Finally, the InSAR-derived maps, the LiDAR-derived map, and the SF map were integrated to update a previously published landslides’ inventory map and to perform a preliminary classification of the different active deformation areas with the support of optical images and a geological map. Complementarily, a level of activity index is defined to state the reliability of the detected ADA. A total of 28, 19, 5, and 12 ADAs were identified through ascending, descending, horizontal, and vertical InSAR datasets, respectively, and 58 ADAs from the LiDAR change detection map. The subsequent preliminary classification of the ADA enabled the identification of eight areas of consolidation of waste dumps, 11 zones in which earthworks were performed, three areas affected by erosion processes, 17 landslides, two mining subsidence zone, seven areas affected by compound processes, and 23 possible false positive ADAs. The results highlight the effectiveness of these two remote sensing techniques (i.e., InSAR and LiDAR) in conjunction with simple geotechnical models and with the support of orthophotos and geological information to update inventory maps of active deformation areas in mining zones. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bedding-controlled landslides are a common geological hazard for open-pit metal mines and occur on layered rock slopes. It can spread spatially over the final boundary of the dip slope and persist throughout the entire life cycle of the mine, substantially compromising the safety of mining operations. Identifying potential landslide areas and determining the landslide mechanism is crucial for the safety production and slope management of mines. This study proposes a combination of satellite radar interferometry measurement and numerical simulation to determine the landslide mechanism of the bedding-controlled slope in open-pit mines. First, the multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) technique of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is used to capture deformation information in the vertical and east–west directions of the slope, locate large-scale and long-term movements, and preliminarily determine the trend of landslides. Then, a layered slope damage constitutive model is established, and a three-dimensional stability calculation of the layered slope is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 software based on the strength reduction method to study the development and evolution process of landslides. The effectiveness of the method is validated by a large-scale bedding-controlled slope failure in the Nanfen open-pit mine in Liaoning, China, revealing the failure mechanism of the slope under excavation conditions. The study shows that the eastern slope bedding-controlled landslide in the Nanfen open-pit mine is a multizone composite-mode landslide caused by excavation, which belongs to the shear–slip–tension deformation failure mechanism as a whole. This study provides a new method for analyzing the mechanism of layered rock slope landslides under mining activities in open-pit mines, which can be used to assess and predict similar landslides. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Multiseam mining in gully regions has resulted in severe and complex disaster chains, including crack development, mountain landslides, river blockage, and intensified mine water inflow. To prevent and control water inrush disasters, it is imperative to investigate the characteristics and mechanizations of overburden failure under the combined effect of gully terrain and repeated mining in coal seams. This study takes multiseam mining within the gully region of the Xiqu Coal Mine as a case study. The comprehensive analytical method that integrates surface exploration, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurement, numerical simulation, and rainfall-runoff analysis, is used to anatomize the entire process of overburden failure induced by downward multiseam mining and the accumulation process of runoff in the gully region. The results reveal that compared to single-seam mining activities, repeated mining and the occurrence of key stratum (KS) structure failure triggered the comprehensive subsidence of the interburden, producing a cutting-type fracture and stepped subsidence, while the overburden exhibited severe damage. Compared to gentle surface topography, gully slopes are prone to shear sliding under the effects of mining subsidence and gravity, resulting in the connection of the downward cracks of the slope and the upward cracks of the overburden. In addition, if the accumulation formed by gully landslides due to repeated mining blocks the river channel and forms a barrier lake during the flood season, it may cause a surge in underground water. High-precision terrain synthesized by UAV tilt photogrammetry is used to simulate the rainfall inundation range and time of different durations during the “100-year return period” rainstorm in the study area. This study proposes a zoning prevention and control method for surface runoff disasters based upon the characteristics of surface deformation and surface inundation time; this method involves filling surface cracks in runoff areas and submerged and crack development areas, implementing slope cutting and control in potential landslide areas, and strengthening the riverbed in submerged and maximum settlement areas. © 2023},

	abstract = {A considerable number of coal mines employed room and pillar mining in the last century in northern China, where the goaf remained stable for a period of time; however, with the increased exposure of coal pillars, their collapse may gradually increase. The stability assessment of these old rooms and pillar goafs is challenging due to their concealment, irregular mining patterns, and the long passage of time. The methodology developed in this study, based on “space-sky-earth” remote sensing such as InSAR to trace historical deformation, the UAV observation of current surface damage, and comparison of mining spaces, can rapidly detect on a large scale the collapse of old goafs and the trend of damage. This study is conducted with an example of a coal mine in Yulin, Northern China, where obtained quantitative surface deformation values were integrated with qualitative surface damage interpretation results, followed by a yearly analysis of the overlying rock movement in accordance with the underground coal mining process. The results show that from 2007 to 2021, corresponding surface deformation and damage occurred following mining progress. However, the room and pillar goaf areas had not undergone any surface deformation, nor had there been incidents of landslides or ground fissures; therefore, it was speculated that no roof collapse had occurred in this region. The surface deformation and damage associated with underground coal mining are complex and influenced by the coal seam occurrence, mining methods, strata lithology, terrain slope, temporal evolution, and anthropogenic modifications. These phenomena are representative of the coal mining area, and this methodology can provide a reference for similar endeavors. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The mining-induced subsidence has caused severe casualties and poses a threat to the safe operation of coal extraction, especially under the roads, buildings and rivers. This alarming situation demands the large-area subsidence detection and the large-gradient deformation monitoring to ensure safety. Although the traditional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology can monitor surface deformation in high accuracy, unfortunately, it often fails to recover the sufficient deformation when facing the effects of decorrelation and large gradient displacement. Therefore, this study firstly proposes a Stacking-InSAR and coherence gradient fusion method to detect the mining-induced subsidence over large area. Secondly, the robust offset tracking method is applied to retrieve the large-gradient deformation in Buertai mining site. Both Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets are acquired over the border of Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia, China, for experimental test. The results show that 179 mining-induced subsidence sites are detected with the proposed method, and the complete spatial temporal deformation fields are obtained by both Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1A offset tracking method with maximum deformation of 3 m in range direction. This study provides a valuable tool for detecting the fine boundary of mining subsidence and recovering the accurate deformation time series. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The Himalayan state of Sikkim is prone to some of the world’s largest landslides, which have caused catastrophic damage to lives, properties, and infrastructures in the region. The settlements along the steep valley sides are particularly subject to frequent rainfall-triggered landslide events during the monsoon season. The region has also experienced smaller rock slope failures (RSF) after the 2011 Sikkim earthquake. The surface displacement field is a critical observable for determining landslide depth and constraining failure mechanisms to develop effective mitigation techniques that minimise landslide damage. In the present study, the persistent scatterers InSAR (PSI) method is employed to process the series of Sentinel 1-A/B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired between 2015 and 2021 along ascending and descending orbits for the selected areas in Gangtok, Sikkim, to detect potentially active, landslide-prone areas. InSAR-derived ground surface displacements and their spatio-temporal evolutions are combined with field investigations to better understand the state of activity and landslide risk assessment. Field investigations confirm the ongoing ground surface displacements revealed by the InSAR results. Some urban areas have been completely abandoned due to the structural damage to residential housing, schools, and office buildings caused by displacement. This paper relates the geotechnical investigations carried out on the ground to the data obtained through interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), focusing on the triggering mechanisms. A strong correlation between seasonal rainfall and landslide acceleration, as well as predisposing geological-structural setting, suggest a causative mechanism of the landslides. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study communicates a novel seismic stability assessment of rock slopes based on the concept of the limiting slope face (LSF) combined with the method of stress characteristics (MSC) and the modified pseudo-dynamic (MPD) approach. The slope geometry with a target factor of safety (FS) of 1.0 is derived, precluding the need for any preordained slip surfaces in the analysis. Subsequently, the derived LSF in cognition with the morphological aspects indeed acts as a self-guided stability index for rock slopes. Besides, a realistic characterization of the dynamic properties of input earthquake motions satisfying the zero stress boundary conditions is apprehended through the coherent utilization of the MPD approach. The generalized Hoek–Brown (GHB) strength criterion is engaged to capture the factual non-linearity present in the rock strength. Compared to the reported investigations, the present results indicate that the developed curvilinear LSFs are steeper than the traditional linear slopes commonly encountered in the conventional practice. A parametric study accounting for the effect of different influential parameters on the behavior of LSFs is performed in view of various prospective design challenges in rock engineering. With a rise in the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient (kh) from 0.1 to 0.3, a nearly threefold increase in the magnitude of the major principal stress orientation (ψ) at the slope crest but along the slope can be observed. Such enhancement in ψ indicates significantly flat LSF. A sudden rise in the magnitude of ψ can also be observed at the fundamental frequencies of seismic waves due to resonance. However, at kh = 0.1, such aptness declines by 54% at the first fundamental frequency of the shear wave as the rock mass damping increases from 5 to 15%. Thus, the present approach attributes to a rational way for seismic design and stability assessment of rock slopes. Several real-life case studies adopting the current LSF concept further exhibit the accuracy, rationality, and robustness of the proposed methodology. HighlightsConcept of limiting slope face is introduced for the seismic performance of rock slopes.Analysis is performed using an integrated framework of generalized Hoek-Brown criterion, method of stress characteristics and modified pseudo-dynamic approach.An adaptive collapse mechanism is investigated in response to varying seismic wave characteristics and rock mass parameters.A comprehensive review of other prevailing analytical seismic approaches is provided.Rationality of the results is ensured through validation with different published case studies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Landslides pose significant geohazards in both mining and natural slopes, necessitating effective temporal prediction of failure for slope-scale mitigation. The conventional understanding of creep behavior, derived from controlled laboratory testing, often falls short in explaining the dynamic in-situ creep characteristics of heterogeneous soil slopes. This study presents in-situ creep assessments through continuous displacement monitoring of an inactive coal mine waste dump, employing Ground-Based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (GBInSAR). This study explores the applicability of the inverse velocity (IV) method for landslide failure prediction. Additionally, it evaluates the performance of two widely adopted filters, namely, moving average and exponential smoothing. In contrast to prior findings, the study reveals a distinct pattern in the IV vs. time curve, transitioning from an initial linear trend to a new steady-state. Notably, the research highlights instances of false predictions, underscoring the importance of considering potential stick–slip behavior, particularly in dump slopes. Furthermore, the findings on tension crack formation and propagation offer insights crucial for selecting an appropriate constitutive model tailored to the characteristics of the waste dump. The findings from this study contribute valuable knowledge to the field of slope stability assessment and aid in refining the methodologies for accurate landslide failure prediction in complex, real-world scenarios. © Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc. 2024.},

	abstract = {Tailings storage facilities (TSFs) impound mining waste behind dams to ensure public safety, but failure incidents have prompted calls for more robust monitoring programs. Satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has grown in popularity due to its ability to remotely detect millimeter-scale displacements in most urban and some natural terrains. However, there remains a limited understanding of whether InSAR can be as accurate or representative as on-the-ground instruments, whether failures can be predicted in advance using InSAR, and what variables govern the quality and reliability of InSAR results. To address these gaps, we analyze open-source, medium-resolution Sentinel-1 data to undertake a ground-truth assessment at a test site and a forensic analysis of five failure cases. We use a commercial software with an automated Persistent Scatterer (PS) workflow (SARScape Analytics) for all case study sites except one and a proprietary algorithm (SqueeSAR) with a dual PS and Distributed Scatterer (DS) algorithm for the ground-truth site and one forensic case. The main goal is to deliver practical insights regarding the influence of algorithm/satellite selection, environmental conditions, site activity, coherence thresholds, satellite-dam geometry, and failure modes. We conclude that Sentinel-1 InSAR can serve as a hazard-screening tool to help guide where to undertake targeted investigations; however, most potential failure modes may not exhibit InSAR-detectable accelerations that could assist with time-of-failure prediction in real time. As such, long-term monitoring programs should ideally be integrated with a combination of remote sensing and field instrumentation to best support engineering practice and judgment. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Western China is the world's major coal-producing area, accounting for 1/3 of global coal production. Large-scale underground coal mining has led to serious ground deformation that has unique spatial and temporal characteristics. However, there are obvious engineering limitations to using GNSS, InSAR, and other common measurement techniques for monitoring mining subsidence. In recent years, researchers have attempted to use UAV LiDAR to monitor subsidence in mining areas. Point clouds are obtained through periodic ground scanning. Surface subsidence information is extracted through the filtering, modeling, and superposition processes. Conventional point cloud processing usually produces subsidence models that are too noisy and only provide information on surface subsidence. This means that it is unable to capture the horizontal ground displacement accompanying subsidence in mining areas, which hinders the practical application of this technology. A local flat point extraction (LFPE) algorithm based on geomorphic features is proposed. The algorithm extracts flat surface point clouds from the scan data and calculates the precise subsidence value of the ground by superposition to facilitate deformation monitoring. The obtained subsidence volume is spatially interpolated based on the unique spatial distribution characteristics of the mining subsidence basin to generate the initial surface subsidence model. By denoising this model, we can obtain a fine surface subsidence model that avoids significant noise caused by non-ground point clouds participating in modeling and superposition in common processing methods. On this basis, we successfully extracted the horizontal displacement information accompanying subsidence by employing sub-pixel correlation using the surface feature images before and after subsidence. The proposed technical pathway was validated by applying it to a coal mining subsidence area in the Yushen mining area in western China. Results demonstrate that, compared to conventional treatments, the proposed subsidence modeling method using laser scanning point clouds improves monitoring accuracy by over 50% while also obtaining the necessary horizontal displacement information for engineering requirements. These findings confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for acquiring 3D surface deformation in mining areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study evaluated the crustal deformation and associated strong motions induced by the Paktika earthquake. Crustal deformations were determined using the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique and three-dimensional finite element method (3D-FEM) and the results were compared. The permanent ground displacements obtained from the DInSAR and 3D-FEM analyses were similar in terms of amplitude and areal distribution. Strong motions were estimated using the 3D-FEM with and without considering regional topography. The estimations of maximum ground acceleration, velocity, and permanent ground deformations were compared among each other as well as with those inferred from failures of some simple structures in the Spera and Gayan districts. The inferred maximum ground acceleration and velocity from the failed adobe structures were more than 300 Gal and 50 cm/s, respectively, nearly consistent with the estimates obtained using empirical methods. The empirical method yielded a maximum ground acceleration of 347 Gal, whereas the maximum ground velocity was approximately 50 cm/s. In light of these findings, some surface expressions of crustal deformations and strong ground motions, such as failures of soil and rock slopes and rockfalls, have been presented. The rock slope failures in the epicentral area were consistent with those observed during various earthquakes in Afghanistan and worldwide. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {We studied a newly identified, multiple-kilometer-long rock slope failure in the Aiguilles Rouges massif (Chamonix valley, France). Owing to a high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) and field work, we mapped morphostructures, including scarps, open fractures, and counterscarps. In some places, vertical offsets can reach tens of meters and crevasses can be meters wide. The evidence of gravitational activity (boulder displacements from analyses of archival satellite images) and the sharpness of the scarp outcrops together suggest very recent movements. These observations agree with ground displacement rates of a few millimeters per year estimated by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series between 2014 and 2018. We sampled two vertical profiles along the top scarps to define the chronology of the slope failure using beryllium-10 (10Be) surface exposure dating. Glacially polished surfaces cut by these gravitational scarps were also sampled to determine glacial retreat timing as well as to constrain the pre-exposure 10Be inheritance. In total, 11 samples were studied. Our results highlight a significant time lag (approximately 15 ka) between the first evidence of nonglacial activity and the initiation of the slope failure that happened 1.3–2.5 ka ago, depending on the inheritance schemes. This suggests that the delayed opening of the crevasse is only one stage of a process that began when the valley was deepened and the glacial debuttressing is not the unique driving factor. This process of progressive failure of an excessively steep slope may continue, and the evolution of this slope failure may constitute a hazard for the upper part of the Chamonix valley. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

	abstract = {Aiming at the land subsidence problem caused by multiple coal seam mining in the Ehuobulake Coal Mine, this paper, considering the geological conditions of the first and fifth layers of coal, adopts the method of combining FLAC3D numerical simulation and SBAS-InSAR technology to analyze the dynamic evolution law of land subsidence amount and range under multiple coal seam repeated mining conditions. The reliability of the technology is verified by the field GPS monitoring data. The results show that, under the mining condition of multiple coal seams in the Ehuobulake Coal Mine, the land subsidence presents obvious asymmetry, and the size and range of the land subsidence in the mining area further increase due to the mining of lower layer coal. FLAC3D simulation results show that the maximum land subsidence is −211.8 mm. The results of SBAS-InSAR monitoring show that the maximum land subsidence is −225 mm, and the land subsidence obtained by the two methods has a high degree of fitting. The method of combining FLAC3D and InSAR technology can accurately and reliably monitor and analyze the land subsidence under the repeated mining of multiple coal seams in the mining area. It can provide effective guidance for the stability analysis of mined-out areas and the prediction of the influence of repeated mining on ground deformation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accelerated deformation and slope instability commonly occur within open-pit mines, indicating the action of potential triggering events such as mining disturbances or rainfall. However, limited studies have been conducted on the deformation behavior of open-pit slopes subjected to the combined effects of mining blasting and rainfall infiltration. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), coupled numerical analyses, and field monitoring for systematic evaluation of the deformation behavior and failure characteristic of a massive landslide that occurred on November 8, 2019 in the Qidashan open-pit mine, China. The InSAR data were reviewed aiming at characterizing the surface deformation fields over the mine site via small baseline subsets technique, as well as identifying unstable slopes and revealing their high susceptibility to mining operations and rainfall. Finite-difference modeling was performed to investigate the response mechanisms and factor of safety of the unstable slope, which were validated by using field data monitored with the global navigation satellite system. The simulation results indicate that the Qidashan landslides were triggered by intense rainfall causing a gradual reduction of shear strength, and mining activities promoted failure by providing stress relaxation and blasting disturbance. Furthermore, this study contributes critical insight into the identification of deformation and early warning of unstable slopes in frequent mining environments, and allows for a back-analysis of the failure mechanism of landslide reactivation. This study highlights how important it is to account for the combined effects of mining and rainfall infiltration when assessing the stability of open-pit slopes, which can mitigate the failure risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In recent years, photovoltaic power generation and greenhouse planting (PPG&GP) have become effective approaches for reconstructing and restoring the ecological environment of old coal-mining industry bases, such as Xintai City. However, the ecological impacts or improvements of the PPG&GP projects and their daily operations on the local environment are still unclear. To solve these problems, this study retrieved the ground deformation velocities and time series of the study region by performing the Small-Baseline Subset (SBAS)-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR and Sentinel-1 SAR datasets. With these deformation results, the spatial analysis indicated that the area of the subsidence region within the PPG&GP projects reached 10.70 km2, with a magnitude of approximately −21.61 ± 12.10 mm/yr. Also, even though the ground deformations and their temporal changes were both visible in the construction and operation stages of the PPG&GP projects, the temporal analysis demonstrated that most observation points finally entered into the stationary phases in the late stage of the observation period. This phenomenon validated the effectiveness of the PPG&GP projects in enhancing the ground surface stability in coal-mining areas. Additionally, the precipitation, geological structure, increased coal-mining depths, and emergent agricultural modes were assumed to be the major impact factors controlling the ground deformation within the local PPG&GP projects. Finally, a novel risk assessment method with a designed index of IRA was utilized to classify the ground subsidence risks of the PPG&GP projects into three levels: Low (69.7%), Medium (16.9%), and High (9.4%). This study sheds a bright light on the ecological monitoring and risk management of the burgeoning industrial and agricultural infrastructures, such as the PPG&GP projects, constructed upon the traditional coal-mining areas in China from a multi-temporal InSAR perspective. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Kaiyang landslides in southwest China have brought heavy damages to lives and properties due to years of underground phosphate mining. However, affected by karst geomorphology including dense vegetation, complex topography, few in situ measurements were conducted to investigate the potentially unstable slopes and derive the kinematic process. In this study, 19 L-band ALOS/PALSAR-2 images are selected, and both phase-stacking and distributed scatterers (DS) InSAR methods are employed to identify the unstable slopes and to derive the spatiotemporal evolution of Kaiyang landslides. At first, we calculate the annual deformation rate and investigate the unstable slopes in a wide range of Kaiyang County through the phase-stacking method. Then, the typical landslides suffering apparent deformation are taken as the region of interest (ROI), and the effects of spatial and temporal decorrelation are suppressed by the process of phase enhancement and point-target optimization. The influence of trigger factors on the Kaiyang landslides is assessed subsequently by the logistic model and precipitation data. Finally, the previous and current failure processes of Kaiyang landslides are analyzed according to the deformation process. The results reveal that the continuous underground phosphate mining leads to the ongoing expansion of the Kaiyang landslides. It can not only reactivate the previous landslide, but also accelerate the deformation of the slope under the action of strong precipitation. Furthermore, the technical route presented in this research can provide valuable guidance for the monitoring and mitigation of mining-induced landslides in the karst mountain areas. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been invaluable for studying earth surface deformation and related effects. Deformation maps generated through multi-temporal InSAR processing methods are however difficult to interpret accurately by general individual users, decision-makers, and non-domain experts owing to the volume, variety, and velocity they are produced. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine learning based information mining approach to simplify these deformation maps and detect hotspots by extracting prominent signals from time series deformation. The approach initially combines two machine learning based clustering methods named time series k-means (TSKM) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to derive clusters with unique spatiotemporal deformation behavior, using time series deformation output generated from Wavelet-based InSAR (WabInSAR) method. Clustering results generated from this unsupervised machine learning approach are later used as training labels to develop two deep learning models, one using long short term memory (LSTM) networks alone and another using a combination of LSTM and single-layer perceptron for supervised training. The developed LSTM and LSTM + Perceptron models efficiently learn from the cluster labels, reaching an accuracy of 97.3 %. Further, the deep learning models significantly reduce the computational time from orders of days (∼5) to hours (∼2) while training and from hours to minutes during prediction. We evaluate the developed approach over Los Angeles, a highly challenging area affected by umpteen deformation events that are challenging to categorize. The outcome of the proposed approach produces hotspots of deforming areas in Los Angeles, providing a generalized and more precise picture of events, much appreciable to non-domain experts. The approach can augment any of the multi-temporal InSAR processing chains and is applicable to different deformation prone sites, aiding in derivation of deformation hotspots from time series deformation maps. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the present study, we investigate the subsidence phenomenon affecting some neighborhoods located to the west of the city of Maceió, State of Alagoas (northeastern Brazil), which is due to the underground solution mining of halite (NaCl) from 1977 to 2019. The first symptoms of this phenomenon, such as surface cracks, ground depressions, small earthquakes, etc., began to be noticed only in 2018. So far, it has already caused enormous damage to the local population, resulting in the creation of true “ghost” neighborhoods. In this study, we have integrated surface displacement determined from satellite images using the persistent scatterer interferometry and the small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR techniques for the period of 2016–2020, and 2D numerical modelling based on the finite element method. The results showed a wide surface subsidence (2.6 km2) with maximum vertical displacements of − 100 cm and maximum subsidence rate of − 22 cm/year. Variations in the mechanical properties of geological faults significantly affect surface subsidence pattern. We speculate that the reactivation of fractures may be an important mechanism leading to the formation/propagation of numerous cracks at the surface. Finally, the study may provide a better understanding about settlement dynamics in salt dissolution fields. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques are important for landslide detection and monitoring; however, several limitations and uncertainties, such as the unique north–south flying direction and side-look radar observing geometry, currently limit the ability of InSAR to credibly detect landslides, especially those related to high and steep slopes. Here, we conducted experimental and statistical analysis on the feasibility of time-series InSAR monitoring for steep slopes using ascending and descending SAR images. First, the theoretical (TGNSS), practical (PGNSS), and terrain (Hterrain) (T-P-H) indices for sensitivity evaluations of the slope displacement monitoring results from time-series InSAR were proposed for slope monitoring. Subsequently, two experimental and statistical studies were conducted for the cases with and without Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) monitoring data. Our experimental results of two high and steep open-pit mines showed that the defined theoretical and practical sensitivity indices can quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of ascending and descending InSAR observations in steep-slope deformation monitoring with GNSS data, and the terrain sensitivity index can qualitatively evaluate the feasibility of landslide monitoring results from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 satellite data without GNSS data. We further demonstrate the generalizability of these proposed indices using four landslide cases with both public GNSS and InSAR monitoring data and 119 landslide cases with only InSAR monitoring data. The statistical results indicated that greater indices correlated with higher reliability of the monitoring results, suggesting that these novel indices have wide suitability and applicability. This study can help to improve the practice of slope deformation monitoring using spaceborne InSAR, especially for high and steep slopes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of landslide susceptibility mapping is influenced by the quality of sample data, factor systems, and assessment methods. This study aims to enhance the representativeness and overall quality of the sample dataset through an effective sample expansion strategy, achieving greater precision and reliability in the landslide susceptibility model. An integrated interpretative framework for landslide susceptibility assessment is developed using the XGBoost-SHAP-PDP algorithm to deeply investigate the key contributing factors of landslides in karst areas. Firstly, 17 conditioning factors (e.g., surface deformation rate, land surface temperature, slope, lithology, and NDVI) were introduced based on field surveys, satellite imagery, and literature reviews, to construct a landslide susceptibility conditioning factor system in line with karst geomorphology characteristics. Secondly, a sample expansion strategy combining the frequency ratio (FR) with SBAS-InSAR interpretation results was proposed to optimize the landslide susceptibility assessment dataset. The XGBoost algorithm was then utilized to build the assessment model. Finally, the SHAP and PDP algorithms were applied to interpret the model, examining the primary contributing factors and their influence on landslides in karst areas from both global and single-factor perspectives. Results showed a significant improvement in model accuracy after sample expansion, with AUC values of 0.9579 and 0.9790 for the training and testing sets, respectively. The top three important factors were distance from mining sites, lithology, and NDVI, while land surface temperature, soil erosion modulus, and surface deformation rate also significantly contributed to landslide susceptibility. In summary, this paper provides an in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of LSM in predicting landslide occurrence in complex terrain environments. The reliability and accuracy of the landslide susceptibility assessment model were significantly improved by optimizing the sample dataset within the karst landscape region. In addition, the research results not only provide an essential reference for landslide prevention and control in the karst region of Southwest China and regional central engineering construction planning but also provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of geologic hazards globally, showing a wide range of application prospects and practical significance. © 2024 by the authors.},

The best-prediction LOS displacement model was characterized by R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 5 mm, which proved the high effectiveness and a high degree of explanation of the variation of the dependent variable. The identified statistically significant driving variables included duration of exploitation, the area of the exploitation field, energy, goaf area, and the average depth of field exploitation. The results of the research indicate the great potential of the proposed solutions due to the availability of data (found in the resources of each mine), and the effectiveness of the methods used. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The continuous monitoring of ground deformations can be provided by various methods, such as leveling, photogrammetry, laser scanning, satellite navigation systems, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and many others. However, ensuring sufficient spatiotemporal resolution of high-accuracy measurements can be challenging using only one of the mentioned methods. The main goal of this research is to develop an integration methodology, sensitive to the capabilities and limitations of Differential Interferometry SAR (DInSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) monitoring techniques. The fusion procedure is optimized for local nonlinear strong deformations using the forward Kalman filter algorithm. Due to the impact of unexpected observations discontinuity, a backward Kalman filter was also introduced to refine estimates of the previous system’s states. The current work conducted experiments in the Upper Silesian coal mining region (southern Poland), with strong vertical deformations of up to 1 m over 2 years and relatively small and horizontally moving subsidence bowls (200 m). The overall root-mean-square (RMS) errors reached 13, 17, and 35 mm for Kalman forward and 13, 17, and 34 mm for Kalman backward in North, East, and Up directions, respectively, in combination with an external data source - GNSS campaign measurements. The Kalman filter integration outperformed standard approaches of 3-D GNSS estimation and 2-D InSAR decomposition. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper presents an extraction method for large gradient three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas using single-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Boltzmann function, and subsidence characteristics. This is mainly aimed at overcoming the limitations of surface deformation monitoring in mining areas by using single-track InSAR technology. One is that the rapid and large gradient deformation of the mine surface usually leads to image decoherence, which makes it difficult to obtain correct deformation information. Second, the surface deformation monitored by InSAR is only one-dimensional line of sight (LOS) displacement, and thus it is difficult to reflect the real 3-D displacements of the surface. Firstly, the Boltzmann function prediction model (BPM) is introduced to assist InSAR phase unwrapping; thus the missing large gradient deformation phase of InSAR is recovered. Then, the subsidence characteristics in mining horizontal (or near-horizontal) coal seams are used as prior knowledge for theoretical derivation, and a 3-D displacement extraction model of coal seam mining with single-track InSAR is constructed. The feasibility of the method is verified by simulating LOS displacements with random noise and underestimation phenomenon caused by the large gradient deformation as InSAR observations. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of 3-D displacements on the observation line calculated by the proposed method is 21.5 mm, 19.0 mm, and 32.9 mm, respectively. Based on the single-track Sentinel-1 images, the method in this paper was applied to the extraction of surface 3-D displacements in the Huaibei coal mine, and the experimental results show that the extracted 3-D displacements are in good agreement with that of measurement by the surface observation station. The proposed method can adapt to limited InSAR acquisitions and complex monitoring environments. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {During the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based ground displacement monitoring in mining areas, the overlying land is mainly covered by low vegetation and arable land, which makes interferograms acquired by InSAR techniques easily susceptible to decorrelation, resulting in the quantity and density of highly coherent points (CPs) are not enough to reflect the spatial location and spatio-temporal evolution process of ground displacement, which is hardly meeting requirements of high-precision ground displacement monitoring. In this study, we developed an approach for monitoring ground displacement in mining areas by integrating Persistent Scatterer (PS), Slowly Decoherent Filtering Phase (SDF), and Distributed Scatterer (DS) based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to increase the spatial density of CPs. A case study based on a mining area in Heze was carried out to verify the reliability and feasibility of the proposed method in practical applications. Results showed that there were four significant displacement areas in the study area and the quantity of CPs acquired by the proposed method was maximum 6.7 times that of conventional PS-InSAR technique and maximum 2.3 times that of SBAS-InSAR technique. The density of CPs acquired by the proposed method increased significantly. The acquired ground displacement information of the study area was presented in more detail. Moreover, the monitoring results were highly consistent with ground displacement results extracted by PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR methods in terms of displacement trends and magnitudes. © 2023 by the authors.},

To identify different morphological expressions of degradation processes that lead to rock mass destabilization, we combined satellite and uncrewed aircraft system (UAS)-based products over two study sites along the State Highway 133 sector near Paonia Reservoir, Colorado (USA). Along with a PS-InSAR analysis covering the 2017–2021 interval, a high-resolution dataset composed of optical, thermal and multi-spectral imagery was systematically acquired during two UAS surveys in September 2021 and June 2022. After a pre-processing step including georeferencing and orthorectification, the final products were processed through object-based multispectral classification and change detection analysis for highlighting moisture or lithological variations and for identifying areas more susceptible to deterioration and detachments at the small and micro-scale. The PS-InSAR analysis, on the other hand, provided multi-temporal information at the catchment scale and assisted in understanding the large-scale morpho-evolution of the displacements. This synergic combination offered a multiscale perspective of the superimposed imprints of denudation and mass-wasting processes occurring on the study site, leading to the detection of evidence and/or early precursors of rock collapses, and effectively supporting asset management maintenance practices. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, while ground deformation related to most active mines is constantly monitored today, the ground instabilities around historical and dismissed mining areas often remain disregarded. Here, we combined a multidisciplinary dataset of historical mining reports and maps, aerial images, field measurements and InSAR observations to reconstruct the spatial and temporal evolution of ground deformation around a sinkhole prone area in the mining district of Gavorrano (Tuscany, Italy). We identified the three sinkholes of Monte Calvo, Valsecchi, and Ravi, with the latter two never reported in literature. The three sinkholes have a spatial correlation with the underground cavities and galleries of major mines. InSAR observations between 20162022 also revealed that an area of ∼ 700 m × 400 m around the Monte Calvo sinkhole is still subsiding with rates of ∼5 mm/yr. Conversely, no clear evidence of deformation is observed at Valsecchi, Ravi, and the nearby city of Gavorrano. Our observations suggest that the sinkhole activity in Gavorrano has been induced by the mining activity in the area and that subsidence is still ongoing at Monte Calvo. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {There exist many high-steep rock slopes in Southwest China due to the construction of large-scale hydropower projects. The study on excavation-induced damage of high rock slopes is vital for disaster prevention and mitigation. Due to the complexity of high-steep rock slopes, assessing the excavation-induced deterioration of rock mass is often challenging. This study used the space-borne Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and multipoint displacement meters to monitor the slope displacements before and after the excavation. Based on the multi-source monitoring data and the parameter estimation method, we evaluated the changes in rock mass properties due to slope excavation. We employed an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm with dynamic topology and adaptive parameter adjustment and a neural network-based surrogate model in the parameter estimation. The degradation of rock mass strength and stiffness coincides with the increased sensitivity of slope deformation to rainfall infiltration. An in-depth analysis indicates that the absence of vegetation protection and excavation-induced deterioration of rock masses are responsible for the noticeable slope deformation during the rainy season. As slope excavation profoundly influences slope stability and deformation, we should pay closer attention to the excavation way and support style. This study also demonstrates the benefits of using multi-source monitoring data in slope deformation analysis. The findings can aid in comprehending the deformation evolution and instability mechanisms of rock slopes excavated at the hydropower sites, thereby contributing to the prevention and mitigation of landslide disasters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Large rocky landslides induced by underground mining are the primary type of geological disaster in the karst mountains of southwestern China. In this study, by integrating field surface surveys, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) monitoring, and discrete element simulations, we analyzed the deformation evolution of steep cliffs with karst structural planes under mining disturbance. Based on the stress transfer, deformation response, and instability precursors, a landslide instability model was developed. The results revealed that the instability boundaries and the instability mode were controlled by the large structural plane at the top of the mountain. Underground mining accelerated the uneven subsidence of the overlying strata, which led to expansion and penetration of the karst fissure structural planes and fracturing of the rock base, which are the main reason for the instability of the mountain. Underground mining caused internal stress fluctuation of the overlying strata, and the mountain experienced four stages during this process, i.e., development of karst fissure structural planes, fissures expansion and rock base fracturing, further fissures expansion and rock base crashing, and fissures penetration and shear failure. The mining-induced failure of mountain with large karst structural planes can be described as tensile shear-fracturing crashing failure. The InSAR monitoring results revealed that accelerated deformation occurred in the source area starting 20 days before the Baiyan landslide. In addition, 25 potential deformation landslides were identified in Zhijin County, Guizhou Province. Hence, InSAR technology can be used for early-stage detection and warning of similar landslides. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {On February 22, 2023, a devastating landslide occurred on the mining slope of an open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, leading to the mining area being buried and 53 fatalities. The source area of the landslide measured approximately 500 m in both length and width, with an estimated volume of the deposited material reaching approximately 5 million cubic metres. Based on the severe impact of this incident, our study conducted preliminary research using a combination of methodologies, including particle image analysis, synthetic aperture radar interferometry, interpretation of optical remote sensing data, and post-event news reports analysis. The results indicated that the landslide lasted 23 s from initiation to cessation of movement. The historical deformation indicated that prior to the resumption of the mining activities, only localized deformation was observed at the rear edge of the landslide. However, when mining activities resumed in April 2021 and extended to the vicinity of the north slope, the deformation range and rate in the source area of the landslide rapidly increased. The investigation deduced that the soft foundation at the slope bottom and mining activities are the primary causative factors of this event. Mining activities, which stripped coal seams within the slope and surface rock masses, led to the expansion of tension cracks within the landslide body, weakening resisting forces at the leading edge and thus playing a significant role in destabilizing the landslide body. The evolution of the landslide from incubation to instability could be divided into four stages: early microcrack development, slow creep, accelerated deformation after resumption of mining, and ultimate instability. Therefore, it is of great significance to advance real-time deformation monitoring and early warning systems specifically those designed for mining slope areas by comprehensive measures. Furthermore, enhancing the high-frequency monitoring capabilities of synthetic aperture radar satellites is crucial to reducing the occurrence of these catastrophic events. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Salt domes play a crucial role in hydrocarbon storage, underground construction, solution mining, and mineralization. Therefore, deformation monitoring is essential for analyzing the kinematics and impact of salt domes. This study aims to measure the temporal displacements of the Shah-Gheyb salt dome from 2016 to 2019 and from 2020 to 2022 using the New Small Baseline Subset (NSBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique and to predict future displacements through machine learning models. A total of 14 data layers, including topography, remote sensing, hydrology, and geology group were used in Machine Learning (ML). Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models were employed to project displacements in both the East-West (E-W) and Up-Down (U-D) components through 29 scenarios. In the E-W direction, the salt dome exhibits a displacement rate of 39 mm/year, while in the U-D direction, it varies between −18 and +6 mm/year. ML predictions and SAR interferometry data processing results for the period 2020–2022 were validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient (R). The RFR model demonstrated the lowest RMSE of 1.9 mm for the E-W component, achieving a maximum R-value of 97.3 %. For the U-D component, the RMSE was 2.8 mm, with an R-value of 55.8 %. Evaluation of the predictive performance of the ML models and a comparison of InSAR and ML outcomes indicated that the RFR model predicted displacement along the E-W and U-D directions between 2020 and 2022 with greater accuracy than the SVR. Furthermore, comparing the displacement predicted by the RFR model using SAR interferometry along two perpendicular profiles confirmed the model's precision. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Mining-induced or enhanced geo-hazards (MGHs) pose significant risks in rural mountainous regions with underground mining operations by harming groundwater layers, water circulation systems, and mountain stability. MGHs occurring in naturally contaminated environments can severely amplify socio-environmental risks. A high correlation was found among undermining development, precipitation, and hazards; however, details of MGHs have yet to be adequately characterized. This study investigated multiple mining-induced/enhanced geo-hazards in a naturally contaminated mountain region in Bone Bolango Regency, Gorontalo Province, Indonesia, in 2020, where a rapidly developing coexisting mining sector was present. We utilized PlanetScope’s CubeSat constellations and Sentinel-1 dataset to assess the volume, distribution, pace, and pattern of MGHs. The findings reveal that severe landslides and floods accelerated the mobilization of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) via the river water system, thus considerably exacerbating socio-environmental risks. These results indicate potential dangers of enhanced PTE contamination for marine ecosystems and humans at a regional level. The study design and data used facilitated a comprehensive assessment of the MGHs and associated risks, providing important information for decision-makers and stakeholders. However, limitations in the methodology should be considered when interpreting the findings. The societal benefits of this study include informing policies and practices that aim to mitigate the negative impacts of mining activities on the environment and society at the local and regional levels. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The ground surface deformation (GSD) caused by oil shale in-situ mining poses a threat to land resources and human's lives and property. This study, for the first time, conducts a full stratum simulation of the Fuyu oil shale in-situ pyrolysis pilot base, analyzing the evolution characteristics of the temperature field, stress field, and deformation field of the entire stratum profile during the heating and cooling processes of convective heating mining. Considering the changes in the pore structure, thermophysical, and mechanical properties of the stratum, the environmental geological effects of rock deformation during in-situ mining were identified. Simulation results show that after heating, the temperature within 80 cm of the heating well reaches above the initial pyrolysis temperature of 350 °C for oil shale organic matter, and there is a significant stress concentration near the heat source. In the simulation, ground displacement rises in a wave-like manner during heating, quickly subsides after cooling, and finally stabilizes. Eventually, the entire stratum exhibited subsidence, with a subsidence amount of 0.59 cm. The spatiotemporal deformation trend obtained from SBAS-InSAR real-time monitoring results is similar to the simulation results. By comparing the monitoring results with the simulation results, the synergistic deformation mechanism of underground and ground surface co-deformation during in-situ mining of geochemical reactions in the study area was analyzed. The deformation rate is determined by the thermal hysteresis phenomenon and the temperature difference between the heated fluid and the rock layer. This provides scientific support for the geological effect evaluation of oil shale in-situ mining, which helps to improve mining safety and efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Over-exploitation of coal mines leads to surface subsidence, surface cracks, collapses, landslides, and other geological disasters. Taking a mining area in Nalintaohai Town, Ejin Horo Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as an example, Sentinel-1A data from January 2018 to October 2019 were used as the data source in this study. Based on the high interference coherence of the permanent scatterer (PS) over a long period of time, the problem of the manual selection of ground control points (GCPs) affecting the monitoring results during refinement and re-flattening is solved. A DInSAR-PS-Stacking method combining the PS three-threshold method (the coherence coefficient threshold, amplitude dispersion index threshold, and deformation velocity interval) is proposed as a means to select ground control points for refinement and re-flattening, as well as a means to obtain time-series deformation by weighted stacking processing. A SBAS-PS-InSAR method combining the PS three-threshold method to select PS points as GCPs for refinement and re-flattening is also proposed. The surface deformation results monitored by the DInSAR-PS-Stacking and SBAS-PS-InSAR methods are analyzed and verified. The results show that the subsidence location, range, distribution, and space–time subsidence law of surface deformation results obtained by DInSAR-PS-Stacking, SBAS-PS-InSAR, and GPS methods are basically the same. The deformation results obtained by these two InSAR methods have a good correlation with the GPS monitoring results, and the MAE and RMSE are within the acceptable range. The error showed that the edge of the subsidence basin was small and that the center was large. Both methods were found to be able to effectively monitor the coal mine, but there were also shortcomings. DInSAR-PS-Stacking has a strong ability to monitor the settlement center. SBAS-PS-InSAR performed well in monitoring slow and small deformations, but its monitoring of the settlement center was insufficient. Considering the advantages of these two InSAR methods, we proposed fusing the time-series deformation results obtained using these two InSAR methods to allow for more reliable deformation results and to carry out settlement analysis. The results showed that the automatic two-threshold (deformation threshold and average coherence threshold) fusion was effective for monitoring and analysis, and the deformation monitoring results are in good agreement with the actual situation. The deformation information obtained by the comparison, and fusion of multiple methods can allow for better monitoring and analysis of the mining area surface deformation, and can also provide a scientific reference for mining subsidence control and early disaster warning. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique is limited in deriving the goaf displacements with a large gradient and fast deformation rates, hindering its application for potential risk evaluation over the mining areas.

By taking the Guotun coal mine as the case study, the TDFPI model was demonstrated to have effectively predicted the large-gradient deformation of the mining areas and successfully evaluated the house damage in Chelou village, which agrees well with our field investigations. Specifically, the predicted subsidence results were validated with high fitting accuracy against field measurements, with RMSE of 0.083 m and 0.102 m, respectively, on observation line A and line F. In addition, the classified damage levels are highly consistent with in situ field surveys for the house cracks in Chelou village, presenting its practicality and effectiveness for building damage evaluation, and thus can provide a useful tool for potential risk assessment and prevention over the mining areas. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Slope failures possess destructive power that can cause significant damage to both life and infrastructure. Monitoring slopes prone to instabilities is therefore critical in mitigating the risk posed by their failure. The purpose of slope monitoring is to detect precursory signs of stability issues, such as changes in the rate of displacement with which a slope is deforming. This information can then be used to predict the timing or probability of an imminent failure in order to provide an early warning. Most approaches to predicting slope failures, such as the inverse velocity method, focus on predicting the timing of a potential failure. However, such approaches are deterministic and require some subjective analysis of displacement monitoring data to generate reliable timing predictions. In this study, a more objective, probabilistic-learning algorithm is proposed to detect and characterise the risk of a slope failure, based on spectral analysis of serially correlated displacement time-series data. The algorithm is applied to satellite-based interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) displacement time-series data to retrospectively analyse the risk of the 2019 Brumadinho tailings dam collapse in Brazil. Two potential risk milestones are identified and signs of a definitive but emergent risk (27 February 2018-26 August 2018) and imminent risk of collapse of the tailings dam (27 June 2018-24 December 2018) are detected by the algorithm as the empirical points of inflection and maximum on a risk trajectory, respectively. Importantly, this precursory indication of risk of failure is detected as early as at least five months prior to the dam collapse on 25 January 2019. The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of spectral methods and second order statistical properties of InSAR displacement time-series data can reveal signs of a transition into an unstable deformation regime, and that this algorithm can provide sufficient early-warning that could help mitigate catastrophic slope failures. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The realization of a harmonious relationship between the natural environment and economic development has always been the unremitting pursuit of traditional mineral resource-based cities. With rich reserves of iron and coal ore resources, Laiwu has become an important steel production base in Shandong Province in China, after several decades of industrial development. However, some serious environmental problems have occurred with the quick development of local steel industries, with ground subsidence and consequent secondary disasters as the most representative ones. To better evaluate possible ground collapse risk, comprehensive approaches incorporating the common deformation monitoring with small-baseline subset (SBAS)-synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique, environmental factors analysis, and risk evaluation are designed here with ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1 SAR observations. A retrospect on the ground deformation process indicates that ground deformation has largely decreased by around 51.57% in area but increased on average by around −5.4 mm/year in magnitude over the observation period of Sentinel-1 (30 July 2015 to 22 August 2022), compared to that of ALOS PALSAR (17 January 2007 to 28 October 2010). To better reveal the potential triggering mechanism, environmental factors are also utilized and conjointly analyzed with the ground deformation time series. These analysis results indicate that the ground deformation signals are highly correlated with human industrial activities, such underground mining, and the operation of manual infrastructures (landfill, tailing pond, and so on). In addition, the evaluation demonstrates that the area with potential collapse risk (levels of medium, high, and extremely high) occupies around 8.19 km2, approximately 0.86% of the whole study region. This study sheds a bright light on the safety guarantee for the industrial operation and the ecologically friendly urban development of traditional steel production industrial cities in China. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Mining-induced seismicity can damage buildings and surface infrastructure and cause fatalities. It is a growing concern, owing to the sudden occurrence of seismic events, lack of effective prediction capabilities, and associated consequences. In this study, we analyzed 13 high-energy mining-induced earthquakes from 2016 to 2020 in Poland's Legnica-Glogow Copper District (LGCD), based on data recorded by the Induced Seismicity-European Plate Observing System (IS-EPOS). We used European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 Copernicus satellite radar images, to study the co-seismic subsidence in the region. Additionally, we employed volumetric point source approximation and a Bayesian inverse modeling scheme to estimate the location and strength of subsurface collapses from the land subsidence data. Finally, we correlated the geological constraints with the land subsidence and earthquake source parameters. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) displacement maps portrayed maximum line-of-sight (LOS) displacements of −144 mm and − 124 mm in ascending and descending images, respectively, with maximum land subsidence reaching −142 mm. Notably, only a few earthquakes with large magnitudes caused land subsidence. There was a significant correlation between earthquake magnitude and land subsidence; the greater the thickness of the loose Quaternary strata, the smaller the land subsidence. According to the inversion results, the focal depths of the collapses associated with the earthquakes were 437–669 m. However, the estimated collapse depths were situated above the mining exploitation fields, within the rigid Triassic rock layers. The associated collapse energy was 1.62 times greater than the seismic energy, indicating aseismic deformation in the field. Additionally, we observed spatial discrepancy between the location of the earthquake epicenters and the maximum land subsidence. Thus, our study can improve the current understanding of the impact of mining-induced seismicity, the occurrence of associated land subsidence, and seismic mechanisms in mining areas. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents a strategy for extracting three-dimensional (3D) mining deformation from a single-geometry synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset. In light of the directionality of horizontal displacement caused by underground mining, we first re-model the proportional relationship between horizontal displacement and horizontal gradient of subsidence. Afterward, to improve the stability of the re-model, a solution strategy is proposed by setting different solution starting points and directions. The proposed method allows hiring of arbitrary single-geometry SAR data (e.g., air-borne, space-borne, and ground-borne SAR data) to reconstruct 3D displacements of mining areas. The proposed method has been validated through simulation and in-site data. The simulation data monitoring results indicate that the root mean square errors (RMSE) of the 3D displacements extracted by the proposed strategy are 0.45, 0.5, and 2.98 mm for the vertical subsidence, east–west, and north–south horizontal displacements, respectively. The in-site data monitoring results indicate that the RMSE of vertical subsidence compared with the leveling data are 7.3 mm. Furthermore, the MSBAS method was employed to further validate the reliability of the proposed method, the results show that the proposed method is effective to obtain the 3D deformation of the mining area, which greatly improves the applicability of SAR interferometry in the 3D deformation monitoring of the mining areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The effect of uranium mining on ground deformation is a relatively unexplored area, especially in terms of surface subsidence related to subsurface ore removal. We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar and spatiotemporal techniques to characterize subsidence signals at the McArthur River underground mine in Canada and the Four Mile in situ leach mine in Australia. We enhance the signal-To-noise ratio of our datasets via time-series techniques and compare results from active periods with results during inactivity to establish a baseline for mining-related signals. We then relate observed surface subsidence to subsurface volumetric strain rates via a voxel parameterization and Bayesian, geostatistical inversion. We use priors on our volumetric strain rates to identify whether these rates are best attributed to ore removal or if additional factors are contributing to subsidence at these sites. We find that the subsidence at McArthur River is best explained by a combination of ore removal and thermal contraction resulting from ground freezing practices. Ore removal via solution extraction alone explains the subsidence at Four Mile, although the localized subsidence pattern and resulting strain rates suggest an intricate combination of sinks and sources in the field, possibly from injection and production well locations and the subsequent flow of solution.  © The Authors.

	abstract = {The adverse combination of excessive mining practices and the resulting land subsidence is a significant obstacle to the sustainable growth and stability of regions associated with mining activities. The Lakhra coal mines, which contain some of Pakistan’s largest coal deposits, have been overlooked in land subsidence monitoring, indicating a considerable oversight in the region. Subsidence in mining areas can be spotted early when using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which can precisely monitor ground changes over time. This study is the first to employ the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)-InSAR and stacking-InSAR techniques to identify land subsidence at the Lakhra coal mines. This research offers critical insights into subsidence mechanisms in the study area, which has never been previously investigated for ground deformation monitoring, by utilizing 150 Sentinel-1A (ascending) images obtained between January 2018 and September 2023. A total of 102 deformation spots were identified using SBAS-InSAR, while stacking-InSAR detected 73 deformation locations. The most extensive cumulative subsidence in the Lakhra coal mine was −114 mm, according to SBAS-InSAR, with a standard deviation of 6.63 mm. In comparison, a subsidence rate of −19 mm/year was reported using stacking-InSAR with a standard deviation of 1.17 mm/year. The rangeland covered 88.8% of the total area and exhibited the most significant deformation values, as determined by stacking and SBAS-InSAR techniques. Linear regression showed that there was not a strong correlation between subsidence and topographic factors. As detected by optical remote sensing data, the subsidence locations were near or above the mines in the research area, indicating that widespread mining in Lakhra coal mines was the cause of subsidence. Our findings suggest that SAR interferometric time series analysis is helpful for proactively identifying and controlling subsidence difficulties in mining regions by closely monitoring activities, hence reducing negative consequences on operations and the environment. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The 17 June 2019 Ms 6.0 Changning earthquake occurred on the southern margin of the Sichuan basin in China, which breaks the historical record for the largest earthquake in the Sichuan basin. Based on the abundant local seismic, strong motion, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar line of sight displacement data, we investigate the detailed source characteristics of this earthquake sequence. We determine focal mechanisms of 68 ML ≥ 2:0 aftershocks with P wave first-motion polarities and S/P amplitude ratios. The triangle diagram of focal mechanisms shows that 82% of the aftershocks have thrust faulting mechanisms. The spatial distribution of aftershocks together with the determined focal mechanisms indicates that this earthquake sequence was mainly controlled by the southeast–northwest-extended faults. In addition, the revealed diversity of aftershock focal mechanisms implies that some small subsidiary faults with different geometries and motion features have likely been ruptured. The kinematic finite-fault joint inversion results reveal a complex rupture process of the mainshock on two fault segments with different geometries. The rupture initiated on the southeastern fault segment with a gentle dip angle and then jumped to the vertical northwestern fault segment. The main rupture length and duration are approximately 11 km and 8 s, respectively. The released total scalar seismic moment during the rupture process is 4:6 × 1017 N·m, corresponding to a moment magnitude of Mw 5.7. Our results suggest that the nucleation and the rupture initiation and propagation of the 2019 Ms 6.0 Changning earthquake sequence were likely controlled by the intrinsic structure and stress heterogeneities of the involved seismogenic faults, as well as the variation in pore-fluid pressure caused by the long-term water injection in the Changning salt mining area and adjacent areas. © Seismological Society of America.},

However, it is of primary importance to implement automated solutions aimed at performing integrated analysis of large amounts of interferometric data. To effectively detect high-displacement areas and classify ground motion sources, here we explore the feasibility of a machine learning-based approach. This is achieved by applying the random forest (RF) technique to large-scale deformation maps spanning 2015–2018. Focusing on the northern part of Italy, we train the model to identify landslide, subsidence, and mining-related ground motion with which to construct a balanced training dataset. The presence of noisy signals and other sources of deformation is also tackled within the model construction. The proposed approach relies on the use of explanatory variables extracted from the A-DInSAR datasets and from freely accessible informative layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and geohazard inventories. In general, the model performance is very promising as we achieved an overall accuracy of 0.97, a true positive rate of 0.94 and an F1-Score of 0.93. The obtained outcomes demonstrate that such transferable and automated approach may constitute an asset for stakeholders in the framework of geohazards risk management. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Accurately predicting ground surface deformation is a crucial task in mining-related geohazards control. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique can widely detect historical line-of-sight (LOS) displacements with a high spatial resolution. By incorporating with spatio-temporal deformation models, InSAR can predict kinematic 3-D displacements due to underground mining. However, this method depends on the geometric parameters (at least seven generally) of underground mined-out areas, hindering its practical applications especially over a large area. To circumvent this, we proposed a new method for predicting kinematic 3-D mining displacements by incorporating InSAR with a temporal model, rather than spatio-temporal models used before, in this article. In doing so, much less prior parameters (only three and can be empirically given) are required, with respect to the previous InSAR-based methods. To achieve this, we first revealed that InSAR LOS displacements caused by underground longwall mining at a single point temporally follow an S-shaped growth pattern. Meanwhile, we also showed that a Weibull model can describe the temporal evolution well. Based on these findings, the proposed method first predicts, in a point-wise manner, the kinematic LOS mining displacements from historical InSAR measurements using the Weibull model and a Kalman filter. The kinematic 3-D displacements are then resolved from the predicted LOS displacements with the help of a common prior information relating to mining deformation. The proposed method was tested in the Datong coal mining area of north China. The results show an averaged accuracy of about 0.007 m of the resolved kinematic 3-D displacements. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The viability and success of a deep mining or tunnelling project is dependent on a safe, reliable support design. In highly-stressed brittle rock, this design must properly account for the excessive deformations and bulking that can occur due to stress-induced extensional fracturing (referred to as spalling or slabbing) near the excavation boundary. Important is the recognition that stress-induced brittle fracturing is dominated by an extensional fracture mode with a directional dilation component that is highly sensitive to 3-D confinement. This behaviour differs from that represented by popular elastoplastic yield and dilation models used in commercial numerical modelling software (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) that have been developed based on experiences involving ductile behaviour and shear in soils and weak rocks. Recent experiences suggest that these are inappropriate for robust design in brittle rock and can be dangerously misleading. The importance of the dilation model and its implementation through a flow rule – which determines the relative incremental plastic straining under a specific stress state and at a specific plastic straining history – has particularly been overlooked. Numerical analyses in most cases adopt the oversimplifying assumption of a uniform dilation model (that is independent of confinement and plastic strain history), using as input a constant dilation angle ψ. This imposes significant limitations in modelling the extent of the yielding zone and the resulting displacements. More advanced dilation models exist. However, they suffer from two key deficiencies: i) most do not account for the influence of the intermediate principal stress, σ2, on the directionality and magnitude of dilation; and ii) many require numerous empirical parameters or variables that do not have physical meaning (neither phenomenologically, nor micro-mechanically), making it difficult for practitioners to intuitively understand the influence and sensitivity of each parameter on the modelled response. This paper, presented in two parts, reviews the mathematical expression of the flow rule and its physical meaning in relation to brittle fracturing, and addresses the deficiencies in current dilation models by developing a new non-potential flow rule that accounts for the directionality and 3-D confinement-dependency of dilation (i.e., both σ3- and σ2-dependency), and uses parameters/variables that have physical meaning. In Part 1, we present a new framework for understanding and modelling the 3-D directionality of plastic deformations in Cartesian coordinates using what we call Plastic Strain Increments Ratios (PSIRs). The 3-D PSIRs are phenomenologically meaningful as they describe relative plastic straining. More importantly, we show that they are micro-mechanically meaningful as they associate the 3-D directionality of dilation with the different 3-D fracturing modes observed in intact brittle rock under various polyaxial stress states. In the Part 2 companion paper, we use these PSIRs to develop and derive the formulation of a new dilation model involving a non-potential 3-D confinement-dependent flow rule. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The Okada dislocation model was used to invert the optimal parameters of the underground-mining ore body causing the surface subsidence, indicating that the surface subsidence is mainly caused by the mining of ore bodies in the 888 and 848 middle sections. We further simulated ground deformation using the multi-source Okada model. The results showed that the predicted and modeled deformations are highly correlated with the observed deformation. Through the analysis and comparison of the InSAR results, it was concluded that the three subsidence areas do not threaten the stability of the main buildings in the mining area. Using theoretical, observational, and modeling methods, the development and evolution of the subsidence area in mines can be established, which could provide basic data for subsidence control work and guarantee mine production safety. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The nature of coal mining areas, such as private exploitation, illegal exploitation, is not only a waste of a large amount of coal resources, but is also very likely to cause geological problems such as surface collapse and cracks. However, existing supervision methods are mostly in the form of mass report, on-site inspection, and geological exploration, which are not suitable for underground goaf detection in large-scale non-target areas. Therefore, this paper presents a method for locating and inversion of underground goaf based on a combination of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques and a probability integral model (PIM). Firstly, the Line-of-Sight deformation of the subsidence basin above goaf generated by combining InSAR and Offset-Tracking algorithm is taken as the real land subsidence. Then, according to the obtained surface deformation, the initial ranges of eight goaf locational parameters are determined, and the correlation function between the surface deformation and the location of underground goaf is constructed. The Oppositional-based Learning Chaotic Bat Algorithm (OLCBA) is used to search the optimal parameters to satisfy the minimum error between the ground deformation calculated by PIM and the Line-of-Sight deformation obtained by SAR. Therefore, the optimal parameters are considered as the characteristics of underground goaf. The simulation results show that the maximum relative error appears in the dip angle of the inversed parameters of the goaf location, which is 3.70%. Taking a known working face of the Daliuta coal mine as the test object and 11 TerraSAR-X images as the data sources, the land subsidence is obtained and compared with GPS measurements, then the underground mining characteristics of the working face is successfully retrieved. Although the maximum relative error of the dip angle is 81.5%, the absolute error is only 1.63° and the relative errors of the other main parameters are less than 15.03%. © 2021 The Author(s)},

In this article, the authors present cross-validation displacement monitoring results obtained via real-time (RT) and near real-time (NRT) global navigation satellite system calculation scenarios. To verify and validate the quality of RT and NRT long-term displacements, an independent postprocessing (P-P) service was established. The study area was located in the Upper Silesian coal mining region in Poland. The verification procedure for the RT and NRT systems included a demonstration of the achieved accuracy, the time span required to detect a significant displacement, and the determination of the minimum detectable value of deformation. Regarding the P-P data source, the NRT service had root mean square (RMS) errors of approximately 2 and 4 mm for the horizontal components, while the RT errors ranged from 5 to 10 mm. In the vertical direction, the NRT strategy had RMS errors of 5-6 mm, while the RT service achieved the accuracy of 10 mm. The minimum detectable values of deformation for the NRT procedure were 5, 7, and 11 mm in the northern, eastern, and up directions, respectively. For the RT system, the significant values were determined to be 10 and 15 mm for the horizontal and 20 mm for the vertical components.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

Operational ground motion monitoring can help detect the spatial pattern of surface changes and their evolution over time. In this technical note, a commercial, cost-effective method combining a network of geotechnical surface sensors with the InSAR data was reported for the first time to accurately monitor surface displacement. The correlation of both data sets is demonstrated in the Gediminas Castle testbed, where slope failure events were detected. Two specific events were analyzed, and possible causes proposed. The combination of techniques allows one to detect the precursors of the events and characterize the consequences of the failures in different areas in proximity to the castle walls, since the solution allows for the confirmation of long-term drifts and sudden movements in real time. The data from the in situ sensors were also used to refine the satellite data analysis. The results demonstrate that not all events pose a direct threat to the safety of the structure monitored. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach to derive the mining-induced goaf deformation, named the fully refined deformation extraction method (FRDEM). In this method, the probability integral method (PIM) and the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique are geographically integrated in a low-cost way to derive the fully refined goaf deformation and, therefore, to improve the detection ability for mining subsidence with fast deformation rate and large gradient. To achieve this, we first established a functional relationship model to connect the 3-D parameters of PIM with SBAS-InSAR. Then, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) was presented for parameter inversion, and thus, the optimal parameter set for PIM and the predicted displacements of the mining goaf was achieved economically. Afterward, we developed a geographically weighted data fusion model by presenting a data fusion strategy to eliminate the spatial heterogeneity in goaf boundary areas, and the fully refined goaf deformation field for the working face 2302 in the Guotun coal mining area was finally derived. Results demonstrate that FRDEM-derived displacements are highly consistent with field measurements, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreasing to 0.053, 0.057, and 0.044 m, respectively, for the entire goaf, goaf center, and goaf boundary field, compared with those of ∼ 0.092, ∼ 0.095, and ∼ 0.084 m for PIM and ∼ 0.578, ∼ 0.696, and ∼ 0.046 m for SBAS-InSAR, respectively. This implies that the proposed FRDEM has significantly improved the detection ability in deriving the mining-induced deformation and, thus, can be a very promising tool to forecast and evaluate potential geohazards in the coal mining area.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most of the coal mines in Southwest China are located in mountainous areas with high vegetation coverage, and most activities are carried out under the mountains. The deformation monitoring and mechanical behavior analysis of the mining area helps reveal the typical mountain deformation and failure mechanism caused by underground mining activities and reduce the risk of mountain collapse in the mining area. In this manuscript, a research method for mountain stability in mining areas is proposed, which combines InSAR deformation monitoring with numerical analysis. Based on the high-precision deformation information obtained by DS-InSAR and the landslide range, a three-dimensional explicit finite difference numerical analysis method was used to reconstruct the landslide model. According to the layout of the coal mining working face, the variation mechanism of overlying stratum stress and the mountain slip in the coal mining process is inverted, and the mechanism of mountain failure and instability in the mining area is analysed. Based on the sentinel data, the experiment performed time series monitoring and inversion analysis of the mountain collapse in Nayong, Guizhou, China. The results show that mining activities a certain distance from the mountain will affect mountain stability, and there are specific mechanisms. From 2015 to 2017, the stress redistribution of overlying strata above the goaf area resulted in dense longitudinal cracks in the landslide body due to coal mining. The mountain is in a continuous damage state, and the supporting force to prevent collapse continues to decrease, resulting in a gradual decrease in landslide stability. Both the time series DS-InSAR monitoring results and numerical simulation results verify the actual occurrence and development of the on-site subsidence. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {From 1910 to 2002, the Mines Domaniales de Potasse d'Alsace (MDPA) exploited two potash layers, located at depths greater than 400 m in the southern Upper Rhine Graben. This mining activity has caused surface subsidence, investigated here using SAR interferometry (InSAR) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) approach is used to follow mining induced surface displacements over the Alsatian potassic basin. The SAR images acquired by three distinct satellites (ERS, ENVISAT, Sentinel-1) over the last 24 years cover both mining and post-mining periods. Until 1996/1997, InSAR results do not fit the high vertical displacement deduced from levelling campaigns due to unwrapping errors and are therefore not reliable to quantify the mining subsidence. From 1996/1997, InSAR results and levelling measurements become consistent, allowing us to study the subsidence following the activity of the mine. The surface subsidence decreases quickly after the end of mining operations, with current subsidence estimated below 5 mm/yr in 2018. The InSAR results obtained for the post-mining period show a correlation between residual subsidence amplitude and the mined thickness. Taking together the InSAR and levelling measurements for the whole 24 years period, the combined time series are approximated by a sum of two exponential terms, which reveals the role of the goaf compaction at depth. The study shows that SAR interferometry is well suited for monitoring small amplitude mining-induced subsidence over the residual phase, helping to better mitigate the related risk in these regions. © 2021},

	abstract = {Ground subsidence is a common geological phenomenon occurring in mining areas. As an important Chinese gold mine, Sanshandao Gold Mine has a mining history of 25 years, with remarkable ground subsidence deformation. Mining development, life security, property security and ecological protection all require comprehension of the ground subsidence characteristics and evolution in the mining area. In this study, the mining subsidence phenomenon of the Sanshandao Gold Mine was investigated and analyzed based on Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and small baseline subset (SBAS). The SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images covering the study area were acquired by the Sentinel-1A satellite between 2018 and 2021; 54 images (between 22 February 2018 and 25 May 2021) were processed using the PSI technique and 24 images (between 11 April 2018 and 12 July 2021) were processed using the SBAS technique. In addition, GACOS (generic atmospheric correction online service) data were adopted to eliminate the atmospheric error in both kinds of data processing. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results showed a basically consistent subsidence area and a similar subsidence pattern. Both InSAR results indicated that the maximum LOS (line of sight) subsidence velocity is about 49 mm/year. The main subsidence zone is situated in the main mining area, extending in the northwest and southeast directions. According to the subsidence displacement of several representative sites in the mining area, we found that the PSI result has a higher subsidence displacement value compared to the SBAS result. Mining activities were accompanied by ground subsidence in the mining area: the ground subsidence phenomenon is exacerbated by the increasing mining quantity. Temporally, the mining subsidence lags behind the increase in mining quantity by about three months. In summary, the mining area has varying degrees of ground subsidence, monitored by two reliable time-series InSAR techniques. Further study of the subsidence mechanism is necessary to forecast ground subsidence and instruct mining activities. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Pixel offset tracking (OT) algorithm is a useful tool for measuring large surface displacements by matching amplitudes in master and slave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, strong backscatters can cause homogeneous errors within a matching window (referred to as patch-like errors) in traditional OT processing, thereby misleading the interpretation of displacement events, especially over a small area. In this letter, we proposed an improved SAR OT algorithm to reduce patch-like errors. In which, a logarithmic transformation was firstly utilized to narrow the SAR amplitude range between strong and weak back scatterers. Strong backscatters causing patch-like errors were then statistically detected with an indicator of median absolute deviation. Finally, those strong backscatters were excluded from SAR OT processing using a weighted normalized cross-correlation scheme, in order to reduce the caused patch-like errors. Two real data tests over the Shuozhou and Yulin coal mining areas, China, suggest that the mean accuracy of the displacements estimated by the presented method improved about 30%, with respect to that estimated by the traditional OT algorithm. The proposed SAR OT algorithm offers a robust option to measure large displacements, especially over a small area, associated with anthropologic or geophysical activities. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of InSAR in monitoring mining surface subsidence is always a matter of concern for surveyors. Taking a mining area in Shandong Province, China, as the study area, D-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR were used to obtain the cumulative subsidence of a mining area over a multi-period, which was compared with the mining progress of working faces. Then dividing the mining area into regions with different magnitudes of subsidence according to the actual mining situation, the D-InSAR-, SBAS-InSAR-and leveling-monitored results of different subsidence magnitudes were compared and the Pearson correlation coefficients between them were calculated. The results show that InSAR can accurately detect the location, range, spatial change trend, and basin edge information of the mining subsidence. However, InSAR has insufficient capability to detect the subsidence center, having high displacement rates, and its monitored results are quite different from those of leveling. To solve this problem, the distance from each leveling point to the subsidence center was calculated according to the layout of the rock movement observation line. Besides, the InSAR-monitored error at each leveling point was also calculated. Then, according to the internal relationship between these distances and corresponding InSAR-monitored errors, a correction model of InSAR-monitored results was established. Using this relationship to correct the InSAR-monitored results, results consistent with the actual situation were obtained. This method effectively makes up for the deficiency of InSAR in monitoring the subsidence center of a mining area. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The failures of tailings dams have a major negative impact on the economy, surrounding properties, and people’s lives, and therefore the monitoring of these facilities is crucial to mitigate the risk of failure, but this can be challenging due to their size and inaccessibility. In this work, the deformation processes at Żelazny Most tailings dam (Poland) were analyzed using satellite Advanced Differential SAR Interferometry (A-DInSAR) from October 2014 to April 2019, showing that the dam is affected by both settlements (with a maximum rate of 30 mm/yr), and horizontal sliding in radial direction with respect to the ponds. The load of the tailings is pushing the dam forward along the glacio-tectonic shear planes located at depth, in the Pliocene clays, causing horizontal displacements at a rate up to 30 mm/yr, which could lead to a passive failure of the dam. The measured displacements have been compared with the ones observed by in situ data from the 90s to 2013, available in the literature. The outcomes indicate that intense localized deformations occur in the eastern and northern sectors of the dam, while the western sector is deforming evenly. Moreover, although the horizontal deformation had a slowdown from 2010 until 2013, it continued in 2014 to 2019 with recovered intensity. The upper and the recent embankments are affected by major settlements, possibly due to a lower consolidation degree of the most recent tailings and a larger thickness of compressible materials. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The judicious use and management of natural resources is vital to achieve sustainable development. Land and water are prime natural resources, and their depletion and degradation can lead to serious threats like land subsidence. Land subsidence is a phenomenon of the alteration of elevation at a point on the earth through the sinking of the surface. It occurs when the earth’s surface loses its support. The major causes of land subsidence include groundwater extraction, mining, construction overload, and other similar factors that increase pressure on the surface and eventually subsidize the land. Urban centers with excessive groundwater extraction and infra-structure development are at a high risk of subsidence. Lahore, the second-largest city in Pakistan, is undergoing an enormous increase in population density, uncontrolled urbanization with very large-scale construction projects, and intensive groundwater extraction which are responsible for subsidence directly or indirectly. Therefore, studies on groundwater status and unplanned urban appraisals have seriously urged monitoring of the subsidence in La-hore. Herein, we used freely available Sentinel-1 data for one year (from August 2018 to August 2019), with a high spatial and temporal resolution, to monitor subsidence in Lahore. The data were processed using the SNAP/StaMPS approach for Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI) analysis, which is an advanced InSAR technique. The displacement velocity map from InSAR processing shows a significant land deformation in the area with values ranging from −114 to 15 mm yr–1. Along with the Sentinel-1 data, we also used supplementary data obtained from various government agencies of Pakistan to study the land cover map, transportation network and waterways of Lahore, soil types, population density, and field points for assessing the results and understanding the roles of various factors in the occurrence of uplift or subsidence. A strong correlation was established between subsidence and various parameters such as groundwater extraction and lowering of the water table, soil type variations, land cover changes, surface water channels, and population density. The deformation map confirms the greatest subsidence in the central part of Lahore, while the uplift is observed in the less populated and rural areas situated near Ravi River. The land subsidence and uplift could be attributed to groundwater extraction and recharge through the canal system and the river, respectively. © 2022, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

	abstract = {In April 2013, Rio Tinto Kennecott Copper’s (RTKC) Bingham Canyon Mine experienced what is arguably the world’s largest ever in-pit slope failure. The failure initiated on the east wall of the mine, along major, continuous, low-strength bedding faults, which were the upper and lower contact of the Manefay hornfels bed. The failure comprised approximately 145 million tonnes of rock and waste dump material. East wall slope deformations were detected some months prior to the catastrophic slope collapse by RTKC’s ground-based slope monitoring systems. Use of existing terrestrial radar and prism monitoring systems provided excellent data to manage the response to the slope collapse. The failure resulted in no injuries/loss of life, although the failure runout distance was longer than expected, resulting in the loss of mining equipment and significant production interruption. Post-failure investigations identified an RTKC-sponsored, university research project, which detected a zone of sporadic ground deformation at the crest of the Manefay failure using satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring. When the outcomes of this research study were received in 2010, RTKC responded by conducting detailed field inspections, installing prisms in the area of concern and monitoring the area closely in the years before the event. Interferometric methods for calculating ground displacement from satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have improved significantly since the time leading up to the Manefay failure. These updated methods have been used in this study of the available historic SAR data with results indicating that significant ground movements were occurring over a number of years prior to failure. Detailed knowledge of these movements could potentially have led to a different interpretation of failure mechanisms and magnitude and, in hindsight, different slope management and mine development plans in the years preceding slope failure. From a business and mine operations perspective, the ability to identify subtle signs of slope failure before a catastrophic slope collapse is essential for appropriate management of such events. The use of InSAR monitoring, as discussed in this paper, provides an increased capability for further improved slope management at RTKC, and at other mining operations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The Stability analysis of datum points is a fundamental procedure to verify the monitoring results of leveling settlement. Traditional methods tend to be the employment of repeated monitoring or the increase in measurement points under the same monitoring technique, which are costly and complicated in data processing, making them difficult to be applied in common ground subsidence monitoring scenarios. In view of this, inspired by the idea of external validation, this paper proposes an evaluation method of the stability of datum points in leveling Observation based on Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology. Firstly, the paper indicates that differences of subsidence measured by SBAS-InSAR and ground leveling of the same location respectively within close proximity are primarily composed of error caused by unconformity of the position, observation time and measurement method error as well as the displacement of datum points. Based on that, the formulas of calculating errors of unconformity of observation time and the displacement of datum points are derived separately. Afterwards, taking the monitoring of surface subsidence caused by the mining of two working faces in Yingpanhao Coal Mine located in northern Ordos Basin, as practical applications, the feasibility of the method proposed in the paper is verified. And the scope of application of the proposed method is also suggested. This study provides an efficient and economical solution for evaluating the stability of datum points in leveling settlement monitoring, promoting the joint combination of SBAS-InSAR technology and traditional leveling when applied to surface subsidence monitoring. © 2022, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Advanced differential SAR interferometry (A-DInSAR) has been used as an effective monitoring tool in mining environments. This work presents an investigation of surface displacement in the Germano iron mining complex (Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil), where on November 5, 2015, the Fundão tailings dam collapsed. Initially, the analysis was performed with 14 Sentinel-1 images, acquired from May 8, 2015, to November 4, 2015, and focused on the Fundão dam before its rupture to detect prior signs of surface deformations. The analysis after the Fundão dam collapse was conducted in the Germano area using 43 Sentinel-1 images, acquired from November 16, 2015 to May 15, 2017, and aimed at detecting surface displacement on the remaining infrastructure, the Sela&Tulipa and Selinha dikes and the main Germano tailings dam, which were directly or indirectly affected by the accident. The results reveal precursor signals of surface displacement at the Fundão dam prior to rupture, particularly on the left abutment setback sector where the collapse started according to a witness, reaching accumulated values of up to -60 mm. The results provided by the A-DInSAR analysis after the dam collapse indicate a stability in the Sela&Tulipa and Selinha dikes as well as in the main Germano dam, which is corroborated by in situ topographic measurements. On the auxiliary dikes within the Germano reservoir, accumulated displacement of up to -90 mm caused by settlements and continuous traffic of vehicles was detected. In addition, the detected accumulate displacement within the reservoir showed values of up to -120 mm, in general caused by settlements of the waste dry material due to the inactivity of the mining process. The investigation emphasized the important role that satellite-based A-DInSAR can play in mitigating possible accidents and for operational planning and risk assessment in mining operations.  © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

The adopted technique employs an InSAR processing chain that exploits a stack of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using a small baseline multitemporal approach. Interferograms with small temporal baselines are first selected, then their network is optimized and reduced to eliminate noisy data, in order to mitigate the effect of decorrelation sources related to seasonal phenomena, i.e., snow and vegetation growth, and to the radar acquisition geometry. The atmospheric disturbance is mitigated using a spatio-temporal filter based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform. The estimated displacement maps and time series show the effect of both linear and impulsive ground motion and are validated against global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements. In this context, a significant threat to the built environment is represented by seismic tremors triggered by underground mining activities, which are analyzed using the proposed method to integrate the information gathered by in situ seismometer devices. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Xishan coal mine area in Beijing, China has a long history of mining. Many landslide hazards, in addition to collapses and ground fractures, have occurred in this area. This study used multi-temporal satellite images to extract this region’s deformation information, identify landslides and analyze the deformation evolution process of these landslides. Taking the Anzigou ditch as an example, we investigate the “Quarry–Landslide–Mudslide” disaster chain model. We found that the landslide evolution process is closely related to the geological conditions, and usually goes through four stages: initial deformation, slope front swelling and collapsing, rear part connecting and rupturing, and landslide creeping. The surface deformation can be identified and tracked by high-resolution optical images and InSAR monitoring. Under the combined effects of rainfall and topographic conditions, medium and large landslides may occur and trigger a “Quarry–Landslide–Mudflow” disaster chain.

In this study, the activity on the Fushun West Open-Pit Mine (FWOPM), one of the largest open-pit coal mines in Asia located in Fushun, Liaoning Province, China, was analyzed by using a time-series Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence dataset. By using the difference between the two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the area, it was possible to confirm that there was a stockpiling activity in the western area of the FWOPM while excavation activity in the eastern area. By using RGB composite images using the yearly-averaged InSAR coherence images, the activity of the mine was confirmed by period, which was confirmed by Google Earth optical images. As a result, it was possible to confirm three landslides and the related activities on the northwest slope and the dumping activity on the west slope of FWOPM.

	abstract = {The previous multi-track InSAR (MTI) method can be used to retrieve mining-induced three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements with high spatial–temporal resolution by incorporating multi-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with a prior model. However, due to the track-by-track strategy used in the previous MTI method, no redundant observations are provided to estimate 3D displacements, causing poor robustness and further degrading the accuracy of the 3D displacement estimation. This study presents an improved MTI method to significantly improve the robustness of the 3D mining displacements derived by the previous MTI method. In this new method, a fused-track strategy, instead of the previous track-by-track one, is proposed to process the multi-track InSAR measurements by introducing a logistic model. In doing so, redundant observations are generated and further incorporated into the prior model to solve 3D displacements. The improved MTI method was tested on the Datong coal mining area, China, with Sentinel-1 InSAR datasets from three tracks. The results show that the 3D mining displacements estimated by the improved MTI method had the same spatial–temporal resolution as those estimated by the previous MTI method and about 33.5% better accuracy. The more accurate 3D displacements retrieved from the improved MTI method can offer better data for scientifically understanding the mechanism of mining deformation and assessing mining-related geohazards. © 2021 by the authors.

Satellite SAR interferometry capabilities for the evaluation of ground movements allows the monitoring of intensive surface mine subsidence and can provide new knowledge about the risks in the mining industry. This work integrates both conventional and advanced Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) to study the ground subsidence in the Legnica Glogow Copper District (LGCD, Poland) by processing about 400 Sentinel-1 images from October 2014 to April 2019. Even without field data and information on past and ongoing excavation activities, the DInSAR approach allowed us to identify 30 troughs of subsidence, ranging from 500 m to 2.5 km in diameter, which in some cases, took place several times during the analyzed time span. The cumulative subsidence in 4 years and 7 months exceeds 70 cm in several zones of the LGCD. The sub-centimetric precision achieved by advanced analysis (A-DInSAR), allowed us to monitor the real extent of the mining influence area on the surface, with deformation velocities of up to 50 mm/year. The ground deformation detected at LGCD can be due to both mining-induced tremors and roof subsidence above the underground excavation rooms. As deformations do not occur concurrently with tremors, this can be related to excavation activities or to degradation of abandoned mines. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This study numerically simulated the failure process of Pusa landslide by distinct element method (UDEC). The Voronoi diagram algorithm was used to discretize the rock blocks in the upper part of the mining area, and the erosion in sliding source area caused by heavy rainfall was simulated by increasing the block density and reducing the joint strength. Results obtained using UDEC matched the failure process recorded by UAV, and the subsidence of monitoring points on the slope surface was well coincident with the InSAR results. The DEM results are as follows: firstly, under the action of underground coal mining, the overlying strata of the mountain deform toward the goaf and the deformation of the stratum increase significantly with the caving of the roof stratum; and the deep karst fissures in the overlying stratum have an important influence on the deformation of the mountain; the upper strata form a subsidence zone along the fissures, expanding the range of tensile fissures. Secondly, due to the excavation and unloading of the rock masses at the leading edge of the sliding area, the extrusion deformation occurs to the outside of the slope, resulting in the critical instability of sliding area. Finally, with the strength decreasing of rock masses and structural planes by heavy rainfall, the stability of the mountain continues to decrease until the sliding area collapses.  © 2022 Nanyun Wang et al.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of collapses and landslides due to underground mining has its unique failure mechanism, especially in the Karst mountainous regions of China. Spaceborne and airborne remote sensing observations provide rapid and effective tools for assessing surface changes and monitoring surface deformation of such landslides. In this study, we take the Jianshanying landslide, a typical mining-induced and fast-deformed landslide, as an example, and reveal the failure mechanism of such landslide by investigating the historical surface displacement. First, the complete evolution of the landslide surface was investigated from its original state to the overall sliding. The data include the satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) optical images, UAV three-dimensional (3-D) real scene models, high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEM, and field survey. The results show that the head region entered the high deformation stage after 2019, the maximum deformation rate was 12.3 m/yr. The landslide morphology was formed after the overall slide occurred in September 2020. Then, the pre-event 3-D surface deformation after the landslide entered the high deformation stage was recovered using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), differential DEM, and SAR/optical offset-tracking techniques. The vertical deformation was recovered around −30 m from 2019 to 2020. In particular, we solved the problem of unequal accuracy of SAR and optical offset-tracking observations in 3-D deformation inversion by employing the Helmert variance component estimation method. The maximum deformation was 6 m and 3 m within 4 months in the NS and EW directions, respectively. Finally, we revealed the failure mechanism of the Jianshanying landslide based on the disparity of horizontal and vertical deformation. That is, underground mining causes a significant subsidence of the rear part of the landslide body, resulting in different stress changes in the rear and front parts of the landslide body, which eventually led to sliding of the front part of the slope along the free surface. This work investigates and monitors the typical underground mining-induced Jianshanying landslide by using multi-sensor remote sensing approaches to trace the pre-event surface motions and to reveal its failure mechanism. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, subsidence has emerged as a significant issue affecting urban, coastal, and mining areas worldwide. This phenomenon has been exacerbated by a decrease in groundwater resources, which has become a major problem on a global scale. Insufficient availability of surface water has led to excessive exploitation of the earth’s groundwater system through unplanned processes. As a result, serious problems have arisen, including economic challenges, hazardous activities, and damage to the Earth’s surface. One of the most significant and impactful consequences of excessive groundwater extraction is land subsidence. During a comprehensive literature review focusing on land displacement, 40 research papers were analyzed and discussed. These studies explored various techniques employed to monitor subsidence, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR), interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR), and differential synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR). Researchers have consistently found a strong correlation between the over extraction of underground fluids, such as water, oil, and gas, and land subsidence. One prominent cause of land subsidence identified by researchers is the over extraction of underground fluids. When excessive amounts of water, oil, or gas are extracted from underground reservoirs, the resulting voids and reduced pressure cause the overlying land to sink and compact. This process can have severe consequences for human settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems in affected areas. The depletion of groundwater reserves, in particular, has become a pressing concern because of its vital role in supporting agricultural, industrial, and domestic water needs. Furthermore, the underground construction of tunnels has also been identified as a significant contributor to land subsidence. The excavation of tunnels creates voids and alters the natural balance of underground structures, leading to ground settlement and subsidence. This issue is particularly relevant in urban areas where extensive tunneling projects are undertaken to facilitate transportation, utilities, and infrastructure development. To monitor and assess land subsidence, various methods and processes are employed. SAR, InSAR, PS-InSAR, and D-InSAR techniques are valuable tools in this regard. SAR uses satellite-based radar systems to capture high-resolution images of the Earth’s surface, enabling the detection of subtle changes over time. In contrast, InSAR employs two or more radar images to measure ground deformation by analyzing interference patterns. PS-InSAR focuses on persistent scatterers, which are specific targets that exhibit stable radar reflections over time, providing precise measurements of subsidence. D-InSAR combines two radar images acquired at different times to accurately calculate differential ground movements. By using advanced monitoring methods, scientists can assess the extent of subsidence and develop strategies to mitigate its negative impacts. It is crucial to adopt sustainable practices and ensure careful management of groundwater resources to effectively address this pressing issue. ©2023 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Associaton.},

	abstract = {Shuicheng District is a karst mountain area, located in Guizhou Province, China. Its fragile stratum and frequent underground mining activities makes it prone to landslides. Owning to its wide coverage and frequent revisit, the InSAR technology has advantages in potential landslide identification and deformation monitor. However, affected by dense vegetation and atmospheric delay, it is much difficult to get sufficient effective targets to derive the deformation in this area. Besides, deformation derived from single orbit SAR data can result in the missing identification of some potential landslides and the misinterpreting of the real kinematics process of landslides. In this study, the multi-source SAR data, atmospheric error correction by quadratic tree image segmentation method, and phase-stacking method were selected to derive the surface deformation of this area. Besides, DS-InSAR and MSBAS method were combined to derive the deformation of Pingdi landslide. First, the potential landslides in this area were identified, surface deformation result, optical remote sensing images and geomorphological features were jointly considered. Then, the landslide distribution characteristics was analyzed in terms of slope, elevation and stratum. After that, the deformation along the LOS direction was acquired using the DS-InSAR method. The MSBAS method was used to retrieve the two-dimensional deformation of Pingdi landslide. Finally, the comprehensive analysis of triggering factors and failure process were conducted according to the spatial-temporal deformation characteristics and field investigation. The results indicated that landslides in Shuicheng district were mostly located in the junction of T1 and P3 stratum and mining related. Mining activity was the main cause of the Pingdi landslide deformation, the precipitation was the driving factor of the landslide instability. The research provides an insight into the explore the unstable slope distribution characteristic and the failure process of the landslides. Copyright © 2023 Sun, Zhao, Li, Chen and Chen.},

	abstract = {Surface subsidence caused by underground coal mining affects the hillslope stability conditions. However, few studies have focused on the coupling relationship between slow surface subsidence and landslide occurrences. A detailed landslide and fissure inventory in a coal mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, was produced based on interpretation of multitemporal satellite images and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. We used the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and landslide and fissure spatiotemporal statistics to investigate the spreading process of the slow subsidence caused by underground mining and examined its impact on the occurrence of shallow landslides. The InSAR results indicate that the actual extent of the subsidence zone is larger than the range of underground mining, which formed a subsidence basin along the coal mining panels. The subsidence curves go through initial, accelerative, and slow subsidence stages and characterized by S-shaped, which can be adequately fitted with logistic regression. Moreover, subsidence does not cease after the end of coal exploitation. Logistic models predicted that the duration of residual subsidence reached about 2–3 years. Subsidence significantly increased the likelihood of landslide occurrences. The spatial pattern of landslides is associated with the actual coal mining. We also investigated the clustering phenomenon of landslides and fissures under the impacts of subsidence. The frequency ratio of landslides and fissures increased with the cumulative subsidence. Finally, we propose a schematic view for landslides caused by coal mining and precipitation. This study will be helpful for elucidating the spatial–temporal evolution of slow subsidence and its impact on loess landslides in coal mining area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic failure of a tailings dam at an iron ore mine complex in Brumadinho, Brazil, on 25th January 2019 released 11.7 million m3 of tailings downstream. Although reportedly monitored using an array of geotechnical techniques, the collapse occurred without any apparent warning. It claimed more than 200 lives and caused considerable environmental damage. Here we present the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) technique on satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to assess the course of events. We find that parts of the dam wall and tailings were experiencing deformation not consistent with consolidation settlement preceding the collapse. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the dam collapse would have been foreseeable based on this observed precursory deformation. We conclude that satellite-based monitoring techniques may help mitigate similar catastrophes in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Accurately assessing the photovoltaic (PV) power generation potential in coal mining subsiding regions is of great significance for the transformation of a resource-based city and the goal of carbon neutrality. In this paper, we proposed an assessment method for the PV power potential in coal mining subsidence areas. Both the environmental factors and ground deformation by interferometric synthetic aperture radar were fully considered. Furthermore, the levelized cost of PV electricity in subsidence areas and the benefits were predicted. Yangquan City, Shanxi province was selected as a study case. Results show that the optimal areas for PV power generation under the three-deformation rate ranges of (−40, −10), (−50, −10), and (−60, −10) mm/year in the Yangquan subsidence area are 32.13, 37.89 and 41.22 km2, respectively. The selected optimal PV construction regions agree well with the exiting PV facilities, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The levelized cost of energy is estimated at 0.3934 RMB/kWh. The annual power generation can meet about 33 % of the electricity demand of Yangquan City. This work would guide the construction of PV power generation facilities in the coal mining subsidence areas for the transformation and upgrading of the mineral resource-based cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal ground-movement measurements and mappings have been carried out in the Campine coalfield in Belgian Limburg since the closure of the mines to document post-mining effects. MT-InSAR measurements are compared to groundwater head changes in the overburden and to height data from the closest GNSS stations. Radar interferometry is used to estimate the extension and the velocity of ground movements. In particular, the MT-InSAR technique has been applied to SAR acquisitions of the satellites ERS-1/2 (1991–2005), ENVISAT (2003–2010), COSMO-SkyMed (2011–2014), and Sentinel-1A (2014–2022). The images were processed and used to highlight a switch from subsidence to uplift conditions in the western part of the coal basin, while the eastern part had already been affected by a rebound since the beginning of the ERS-1/2 acquisitions. Following the closure of the last active colliery of Zolder in 1992 and the subsequent cease of mine-water pumping, a recharge of mine-water aquifers occurred in the western part of the basin. This process provoked the change from subsidence to uplift conditions that was recorded during the ENVISAT period. In the center of the coal-mining area, measured uplift velocities reached a maximum of 18 mm/year during the ENVISAT period, while they subsided at −12 mm/year during the ERS-1/2 period. Mean velocities in the western and eastern parts of the coalfield area have decreased since the last MT-InSAR measurements were performed using Sentinel-1A, while the Zolder coal mine continues to rise at a faster-than-average rate of a maximum of 16 mm/year. The eastern part of the coalfield is still uplifting, while its rate has been reduced from 18 mm/year (ERS-1/2) to 9 mm/year (Sentinel-1A) since the beginning of the radar–satellite observations. Time-series data from the two GNSS stations present in the study area were used for a local comparison with the evolution of ground movements observed by MT-InSAR. Two leveling campaigns (2000, 2013) were also used to make comparisons with the MT-InSAR data. The station’s measurements and the leveling data were in line with the MT-InSAR data. Overall, major ground movements are obviously limited to an extension of the actual underground-mining works and rapidly diminish outside of them. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This chapter explains monitoring deformation history due to coal mining using time series SAR analysis. Surface deformation is a very common phenomenon in and around mining areas, and a space-based SAR technique is a promising tool for monitoring land deformation. Monitoring of land subsidence is required to prevent further damage to the mine’s surrounding built-up areas and other vulnerable structures and landforms. This further helps by providing information for improved future mine layout designs and for subsidence mitigation. This study involves time series SAR data processing using L-band datasets for monitoring land deformation using an advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) algorithm referred to as the persistent scatterer (PS) InSAR technique. The advantage of using PSInSAR is that it deals with both decorrelation and atmospheric delay errors of conventional InSAR and provides deformation history with sub-centimeter accuracy. The study was carried out in one of the most popular and largest coal-producing mining areas in India, i.e. the Jharia coal field, situated in Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India. The main objective of this work is to analyze time series interferometric SAR data to detect surface deformation in and around the Jharia coal field. The aim of this research is to present a cumulative displacement map using a number of interferometric datasets and to assess the geohazard activity in the study area. The data used in this study is ALOS-2 PALSAR L-band (2016 to 2019) to perform interferometric data processing and comparative analysis. A high rate of land deformation was observed in and around the mining area, and the land deformation rate was observed at almost ± 30 cm/year in this study area. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Shashi Kumar, Paul Siqueira, Himanshu Govil and Shefali Agrawal; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, ground deformation measurements from synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) and ground-based prism monitoring are compared to finite-element (FE) simulation results for a recent tailings dam collapse. The InSAR monitoring demonstrated the complex spatial and temporal variability of the tailings dam deformation that is not captured in traditional, point-based monitoring approaches. Potentially anomalous deformation behaviour could have been detected from InSAR 1 year preceding the dam failure. A two-dimensional coupled-consolidation analysis was used to predict the dam behaviour during construction stages. The FE modelling results were in broad agreement with the deformation measurement sources, both in terms of magnitude and trends preceding failure. The results, however, deviate significantly immediately before failure, following the construction of the buttresses. Moreover, the FE modelling is sensitive to parameter uncertainties, such as spatial variability of foundation soil properties. The FE results revealed that deformation in both the upstream and downstream parts of the dam are sensitive to changing foundation properties. However, this impact is potentially much more significant on the downstream compared to the upstream parts of the dam, which are dominated by the behaviour of the tailings. This study highlights the efficacy and complementarity of geotechnical and remote sensing techniques for the monitoring of tailings dams. © 2022 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Early detection of rockslides at high-elevation and well-vegetated slopes remains challenging. This study used satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) optical remote-sensing (ORS) images to track evidence of slope deformation and examine potential geomorphological precursors of five large rockslides in China. The multi-temporal image interpretation results were combined with available pre-sliding slope displacement data derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or field monitoring to study the temporal changes in geomorphological precursors accompanying slope deformation. All the surveyed landslides had cracks or scarps and rockfalls within the landslide source area before the onset of rapid sliding. These precursors can be identified in ORS images taken several years or decades before the rapid slope failure, which provides sufficient time for the landslide early detection in practice. Local topography affects the spatial locations of cracks or scarps. Rockfalls within the landslide source area tend to locate at “key blocks” where slope mass provides forces resisting sliding. The rockfall area ratio, defined as the accumulated area of rockfalls over the landslide source area, ranged from 0.33 to 0.92 before rapid slope failure. The landslides developed on anti-dip and igneous rock slopes show a more significant rise of rockfall area ratio before the slope failure than the landslides on dip slopes. Given the broad availability of ORS data, this study could shed light on the ORS-based landslide early detection and landslide kinematics study. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The article presents information on how to use satellite interferometry to detect linear discontinuous ground deformation [LDGD] caused by underground mining. Assumptions were made based on the properties of the SAR signal correlation coefficient (coherence). Places of LDGD have been identified based on these assumptions. Changes taking place on the surface between two acquisitions lead to worse correlation between two radar images. This results in lower values of the SAR signal correlation coefficient in the coherence maps. Therefore, it was assumed that the formation of LDGD could reduce the coherence value compared to the previous state. The second assumption was an increase in the standard deviation of coherence, which is a classic measurement of variability. Therefore any changes in the surface should lead to increasing standard deviation of coherence compared to the previous state. Images from the Sentinel-1 satellite and provided by the ESA were used for analysis. The research is presented on the basis of two research areas located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin in the south of Poland. The area in which LDGD could occur was limited to 6 % of the total area in case 1 and 36 % in case 2 by applying an appropriate methodology of satellite image coherence analysis. This paper is an introduction to the development of a method of detecting LDGDs caused by underground mining and to study these issues further.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {The warming and subsequent degradation of mountain permafrost within alpine areas represent an important process influencing the stability of steep slopes and rock faces. The unstable and monitored slopes of Mannen (Møre and Romsdal county, southern Norway) and Gámanjunni-3 (Troms and Finnmark county, northern Norway) were classified as high-risk sites by the Norwegian Geological Survey (NGU). Failure initiation has been suggested to be linked to permafrost degradation, but the detailed permafrost distribution at the sites is unknown. Rock wall (RW) temperature loggers at both sites have measured the thermal regime since 2015, showing mean rock surface temperatures between 2.5 and-1.6° C depending on site and topographic aspect. Between 2016 and 2019 we conducted 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys on the plateau and directly within the rock wall back scarp of the unstable slopes at both sites. In combination with geophysical laboratory analysis of rock wall samples from both sites, the ERT soundings indicate widespread permafrost areas, especially at Gámanjunni-3. Finally, we conducted 2D thermal modelling to evaluate the potential thermal regime, along with an analysis of available displacement rate measurements based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and ground-and satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods. Surface air and ground temperatures have increased significantly since ca. 1900 by 1 and 1.5° C, and the highest temperatures have been measured and modelled since 2000 at both study sites. We observed a seasonality of displacement, with increasing velocities during late winter and early spring and the highest velocities in June, probably related to water pressure variations during snowmelt. The displacement rates of Gámanjunni-3 rockslide co-vary with subsurface resistivity and modelled ground temperature. Increased displacement rates seem to be associated with sub-zero ground temperatures and higher ground resistivity. This might be related to the presence of ground ice in fractures and pores close to the melting point, facilitating increased deformation.

	abstract = {Micro-variation monitoring radar based on the differential interference principle can monitor objects prone to micro deformation. However, it is easily affected by human and environmental factors to cause the radar image to loss coherence in the long-term monitoring work, thus affecting the normal monitoring of radar. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the change detection method of micro-variation monitoring radar images, which can provide reference information and quantitative analysis for monitoring work. In this paper, a method of landslide area identification and detection based on micro-variation radar image is proposed. Based on the radar coherence coefficient image of time series, the difference image is produced by logarithmic ratio cumulation. The difference map is decomposed and denoised by wavelet transform, and then the final difference map is produced by reconstructing the processed wavelet coefficients. Finally, the improved K-means is used to cluster the difference map to get the change detection result image. The actual monitoring data of a mining area is used for variation detection. The results show that the proposed method retains the detailed information of the change area and removes a lot of noise. The difference map is easier to cluster, and the clustering result is more accurate. © 2022, Electromagnetics Academy. All rights reserved.},

In this study deformation monitoring of Korba underground coal mines in Chhattisgarh, India was performed using the Synthetic aperture radar remote sensing. In this study, the Surakachhar 5/6 underground coal mining region of Korba area and its surrounding are considered for deformation/displacement monitoring. The displacement estimation was generated using Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (ADInSAR) technique: Persistent Scatterer SAR interferometry (PSInSAR) and Ground-based investigation for validation and impact assessment have also been performed. PSInSAR results, obtained by processing of 17 Sentinel-1A images (Feb-2015 to Feb-2017) showed that multiple areas above the underground mining have been deformed around 3 mm/year to −21 mm/year along the radar line of prospect. Deformed regions are mainly on the surface of active mining areas and settlements. Deformation mapping using PSInSAR with ground-based investigation provides an account learning of Surakachhar underground mining activities, consequences such as sag, pit and cracks in the area.

In this paper, the surface deformation time series from 2017 to 2020 is firstly estimated by combining multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and improved offset-tracking methods to overcome the difficulties caused by the large gradient surface deformation and surface material changes. Then, the spatiotemporal characteristics of Jianshanying landslide is analyzed in terms of line-of-sight (LOS) deformation with stacking InSAR method and two-dimensional (2D) deformation with improved SAR offset-tracking method. And the different deformation features between sliding body and surrounding areas are uncovered. Accordingly, we point out the “three-section” surface deformation model. We further analyze the deformation time series by considering the joint effects of rainfall and underground mining. Finally, we conceptualize the landslide failure mode for the Jianshanying landslide, which can be extended to the similar landslide in karst mountainous areas of southwestern China. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR), by providing both mean displacement maps and displacement time series over coherent objects on the Earth’s surface, allows analyzing wide areas, identifying ground displacements, and studying the phenomenon evolution at a long time scale. This technique has also been proven to be very useful for detecting and monitoring slope instabilities. For this type of hazard, detection of velocity variations over short time intervals should be useful for early warning of damaging events. In this work, we present the results obtained by using both COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (S1) data for investigating the ground stability of two hilly villages located in the Southern Italian Apennines (Basilicata region), namely the towns of Montescaglioso and Pomarico. In these two municipalities, landslides occurred in the recent past (in Montescaglioso in 2013) and more recently (in Pomarico in 2019), causing damage to houses, commercial buildings, and infrastructures. SAR datasets acquired by CSK and S1 from both ascending and descending orbits were processed using the SPINUA MTInSAR algorithm. Mean velocity maps and displacement time series were analyzed, also by means of innovative ad hoc procedures, looking, in particular, for non-linear trends. Results evidenced the presence of nonlinear displacements in correspondence of some key infrastructures. In particular, the analysis of accelerations and decelerations of PS objects corresponding to structures affected by recent stabilization measures helps to shed new light in relation to known events that occurred in the area of interest. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Underground mining activity in the region of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) results in ground displacements scattered on a large area. Both the locations and the velocities of the displacements depend on many factors, such as the current location of the mining front, the mining depth and system, as well as geological conditions. Although SAR interferometry techniques allow the monitoring of such ground displacements, in a regional scale (as is the case of the USCB) SAR images must be appropriately processed (from a number of frames and swaths), and this is the problem addressed in this article. The implementation of algorithms for analyzing time series allows observations of displacements in both time and space. The authors also analyze the influence of mining operations on the road infrastructure and mining waste heaps located in the area and investigate the potential for the monitoring of secondary influence (due to induced seismic tremors).

In the study, satellite imagery from thermal and microwave remote sensing data is used to deduce the effect of coal fires on subsidence in the Jharia Coalfields, India. The Thermal Infrared data acquired from the Landsat-8 (band 10) is used to derive the temperature anomaly maps. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry analysis was performed on sixty Sentinel-1, C-band images, the results are corrected for atmospheric error using Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) atmospheric modelling data and decomposed into vertical displacement values to quantify subsidence. A zone-wise analysis of the hazard patterns in the coalfields was carried out. Coal fire maps, subsidence velocity maps, and land cover maps were integrated to investigate the impact of the hazards on the mines and their surroundings. Maximum subsidence of approximately 20 cm/yr. and temperature anomaly of up to 25 °C has been observed. The findings exhibit a strong positive correlation between the subsidence velocity and temperature anomaly in the study area.

	abstract = {The multi-level disturbance of underground and surface caused by coal mining activities intensifies the deterioration of the ecological environment in the mining area. Among them, the uneven settlement caused by coal mining is the most intuitive manifestation of surface environmental damage. The uneven settlement in the mining area has the characteristics of large settlement magnitude and severe deformation. Therefore, based on 15 Sentinel-1A image data, this paper uses three methods: SBAS InSAR, continuous D-InSAR and offset tracking technology to monitor the surface deformation of the mining area. The results show that the continuous D-InSAR technology SBAS-InSAR technology is applied to the small deformation in the edge area of the subsidence basin. The mining area with low gradient subsidence of SBAS-InSAR can obtain better performance than continuous D-InSAR technology. The offset tracking technique is used to monitor the large gradient deformation in the center of the subsidence basin. Therefore, this paper proposes to expand the quantitative analysis through the spatial coherence threshold and the accuracy and successful image elements of the interference fringe displacement. Combine the advantages of the three methods and overcome the shortcomings of each method, fuse the deformation information of the three methods, and obtain the deformation law of the whole surface subsidence. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE1-1) of continuity D-InSAR is 0.92 m, the mean absolute error (MAE2-1) of SBAS-InSAR is 0.94 m, and the mean absolute error (MAE3-1) of Offset-tracking is 0.25 m. The results of this fusion method are in good agreement with the measured data, and the mean absolute error (MAE4-1) of vertical displacement is 7 cm. Therefore, the fusion method has advantages over individual methods and provides a new idea in monitoring the large gradient deformation of coal mining subsidence in mining areas.

	abstract = {In this article, we present a possible approach to use satellite radar data for a complete description of the formation process of a subsidence trough resulting from an induced seismic event—a mining tremor. Our main goal was to verify whether SAR data allow for the calculation of the basic indicators for the trough (w—subsidence, T—trough slope, K—curvature, u—horizontal displacements, ε—horizontal deformations). We verified the extent to which the Mogi and Yang models can be fitted to match the actual displacements recorded after an induced seismic tremor. The calculations were performed for the Legnica-Glogow Copper Belt (LGCB) area in southwest Poland. Due to intensive mining operations and specific geological and tectonic conditions, the area shows a high level of induced seismic activity. Our detailed analysis focused on four powerful mining tremors: the first tremor occurred on 29 November 2016 (MW 3.4), the second on 7 December 2017 (MW 3.3), the next on 26 December 2017 (MW 3.6) and the last tremor on 29 January 2019 (MW 3.7). For each analyzed event, we determined the displacements based on the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) method and Sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from two paths (22 and 73). Additionally, for the period from November 2014 to October 2020, we calculated the displacements using the Small Baseline Subset method (SBAS) time series method. In all cases, the tremor was followed by the development of long-lasting surface deformations. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that it is possible to calculate indicators that result from a specific induced mining event. Considering the full moment tensor and nature of the tremor source, we demonstrated that the Mogi and Yang models can be employed to describe the influence of an induced tremor on the surface in an area of mining activity. We also confirmed the global character of the influence of the reduced troposphere on SAR data calculations. Our conclusions indicate that accounting for the tropospheric correction does not distort horizontal and vertical displacement values in regions influenced by mining activity/tremors. © 2021 by the authors.

To increase the spatial extent of the displacement signal because of decorrelated effects, we modified the traditional Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method to incorporate the coherence into the inverse problem, hereafter we call it coherence-based SBAS method. Instead of excluding decorrelated pixels present in the interferograms, we keep all the pixels in the time series analysis and down-weighted the decorrelated pixels with coherence. We performed the coherence-based SBAS method to both the two SAR datasets to obtain the subsidence rate maps and displacement time-series over the mining areas, and compared the results with that from the traditional stacking InSAR method. We evaluated the effectiveness of L-band and C-band DInSAR for monitoring mining subsidence by comparing differential interferograms and displacements derived from SBAS method between ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A data. Compared to C-band, L-band SAR are less affected by phase aliasing due to large displacement gradients. The most significant subsidence was found at Maliantai mine with −264 mm/year detected by SBAS method from Sentinel-1 data. We validated the InSAR displacement accuracy by comparing both ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 results with 18 GPS stations above five active mining regions. The average RMSE between InSAR and GPS measurements is 28.4 mm for Sentinel-1 data and 21 mm for ALOS-2 data. Our results demonstrate that the combined exploitation of L-band and C-band SAR data through both conventional and advanced DInSAR methods could be crucial to monitor ground subsidence in mining areas, which provides insights into subsidence dynamics and determine the characteristic surface response to longwall advance.

	abstract = {Structural failure prevention is a crucial issue in civil engineering. The causes of structure or infrastructure collapse include phenomena that slowly deform the ground and could affect the stability of foundations such as differential settlements, subsidence, groundwater changes, slope failure, or landslides. When large urban areas need to be monitored, such phenomena are hard to be mapped by means of classical structural health monitoring methods due to the unaffordable quantity of in situ measurements these methods would entail. A very effective alternative is exploiting multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) displacement timeseries which would enable the monitoring of wide geographical areas over a weekly basis and extended spatial coverage. Analyzing the enormous amount of data produced by MT-InSAR may help to assess the time evolution of phenomena but can barely highlight “anomalous” ground deformations in time, to prevent likely structural failure. This paper proposes a method which analyzes the InSAR data through an unsupervised learning paradigm with the purpose of detecting critical events at their early stage. On the basis of similarities among time sequences, this method allows the finding of precursors of anomalous ground settlement behaviors, the correct framing of which should be directed to specialist evaluation and in situ inspections. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Underground coal mining often causes subsidence, goaf landslides, fissures, and even hazard chains, seriously damaging the ecological environment. To address the ecological vulnerability of mining areas is key to exploring the development characteristics and failure mechanisms of surface multi-hazards. Taking the Shuiliandong coal mine as an example, the mine deformation area was identified using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technology. We found that the spatial evolution of the deformation areas was controlled by the mining sequence. The impacts on the surface deformation and the mining-induced landslide were continuous and long term. Thus, the surface fissures and landslide were characterized using historical images. The fissures were clustered and short, and there was a negative exponential relationship between the length and the cumulative number of fissures. The fissure density decreased with increasing distance from the mine tunnel. In addition, the particle flow numerical simulation analysis method was used to simulate the subsidence-fissure-landslide hazard chain process. Three distinct stages were identified: initial stage, rapid development stage, and creep stage. The displacements at the different monitoring points exhibited a distinct S shape. The cumulative number of fissures developed same as the subsidence and landslide, exhibiting an S shape. The fissures played an important role in the hazard chain, accelerating the subsidence and landslide processes. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {It is common to estimate underground mining-induced subsidence from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) displacement observations by Neglecting hOrizontal moVements (NOV). Such a strategy would cause large errors in the NOV-estimated subsidence. This issue was proven and the theoretical equation of the resulting errors has been deduced before. However, the systematic analysis of the error pattern (e.g., spatial distribution) and its relationship between some critical influence factors (e.g., lithology of overlying rock strata) is lacking to date. To circumvent this, a method was first presented to assess the errors of the NOV-estimated mining subsidence in this study. Then, the error pattern and the influence factors of the NOV-estimated mining subsidence were discussed. The results suggest that the errors of the NOV-estimated mining subsidence spatially follow a “peak-to-valley” shape, with an absolute “peak-to-valley angle” of 5–15◦. In addition, for the same underground mining geometry, the error magnitudes of the NOV-estimated mining subsidence under hard lithology of overlying rock strata are smaller than those under soft lithology, and vice versa. These results would be beneficial to guide the scientific use of the NOV method for understanding the deformation mechanism and controlling the geohazards associated with underground mining and other similar anthropogenic activities. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper proposes an approach to carry out an open pit’s overall and whole-process mechanical analysis with complex geological conditions, using precise modeling and large-scale parallel calculation techniques. Taking the Fushun West Open-pit Mine (the largest open-pit coal mine in Asia) as an example, through the elaborate multi-method geological investigation, the interfaces of interbedded shales and mudstones, the unloading zones, and the small structures were identified, a detailed 3D geological model was built and finely meshed in full-size with 100 million degrees of freedom, large-scale parallel numerical simulation was then performed, the results agree well with the InSAR monitoring data and in situ observations. Besides, the simulation can replicate the landslides in recent years. Through the simulation, it is possible to locate the potential landslide area, and targeted backfilling schemes for stability treatment were put forward and further simulated.

	abstract = {The Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has been widely used to obtain the ground surface deformation of geohazards (e.g., mining subsidence and landslides). As one of the inherent errors in the interferometric phase, the digital elevation model (DEM) error is usually estimated with the help of an a priori deformation model. However, it is difficult to determine an a priori deformation model that can fit the deformation time series well, leading to possible bias in the estimation of DEM error and the deformation time series. In this paper, we propose a method that can construct an adaptive deformation model, based on a set of predefined functions and the hypothesis testing theory in the framework of the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method. Since it is difficult to fit the deformation time series over a long time span by using only one function, the phase time series is first divided into several groups with overlapping regions. In each group, the hypothesis testing theory is employed to adaptively select the optimal deformation model from the predefined functions. The parameters of adaptive deformation models and the DEM error can be modeled with the phase time series and solved by a least square method. Simulations and real data experiments in the Pingchuan mining area, Gaunsu Province, China, demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art deformation modeling strategy (e.g., the linear deformation model and the function group deformation model), the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of DEM error estimation and can benefit the estimation of deformation time series. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {It is necessary to timely and accurately estimate the surface deformations in mining areas, especially the 3-D deformations during surface movement. At present, nearly all mining-induced 3-D deformations retrieved by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) pertain to the SAR imaging interval. Research on progressive 3-D deformations during surface movement is limited, and the existing approaches are unsatisfactory in practical engineering. Aiming at these challenges, we proposed a novel method for deriving mining-induced 3-D surface deformations at any moment by integrating single InSAR interferogram (SII), the Gompertz time function, and the probability integral model (PIM), named the SII-GPIM method. We established an inversion approach for GPIM parameters and derived the mining-induced 3-D surface deformations at any moment. Subsequently, we conducted experiments considering two ALOS PALSAR images in the Huaibei mining area. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated in subsidence, tilt, curvature, horizontal displacement, and horizontal strain. Compared with existing methods, the SII-GPIM method is the state of the art. Additionally, we assessed the building damage, performance of parameter inversion, and method generality. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately determine the mining-induced 3-D surface deformations and deformation level at any moment under different geological mining conditions. Moreover, accurate GPIM parameters can be acquired with only two SAR images and traditional measurement is nearly not required. Consequently, the SII-GPIM method owns great value for improving economic efficiency, assessing building damage, and restoring the ecological environment in the mining area.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Kinematics is a key component of a landslide hazard because landslides moving at similar rates can affect structures or collapse differently depending on their mechanisms. While a complete definition of landslide kinematics requires integrating surface and subsurface site investigation data, its practical estimate is usually based on 2D profiles of surface slope displacements. These can be now measured accurately using Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI), which exploits open access satellite imagery. Although 2D profiles of kinematic quantities are easy to retrieve, the efficacy of possible descriptors and extraction strategies has not been systematically compared, especially for complex landslides. Large, slow rock slope deformations, characterized by low displacement rates (<50 mm/year) and spatial and temporal heterogeneities, are an excellent testing ground to explore the best approaches to exploit PSI data from Sentinel-1 for kinematic characterization. For three case studies, we extract profiles of different kinematic quantities using different strategies and evaluate them against field data and simplified numerical modelling. We suggest that C-band PSI data allow for an effective appraisal of complex landslide kinematics, provided that the interpretation is (a) based on decomposed velocity vector descriptors, (b) extracted along critical profiles using interpolation techniques respectful of landslide heterogeneity, and (c) constrained by suitable model-based templates and field data. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Phase unwrapping (PU) is a key step in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface monitoring, which is directly related to the accuracy of the line-of-sight (LOS) displacement observations. Underground coal mining generally results in large gradient displacements, producing dense and aliasing fringes in interferograms. In this case, it is challenging to accurately unwrap interferometric phases using traditional methods. This letter proposes an iterative algorithm to unwrap interferometric phases over underground coal mining areas. First, differential interferogram is unwrapped by the minimum cost flow (MCF) method to obtain unwrapped phases at the edge of the mining subsidence basin. Then, a 2-D elliptical Gaussian function, which could approximately describe the spatial shape of mining subsidence basin, is used to iteratively reduce the phase gradients of interferograms, so that residual wrapped phases at more pixel in subsidence basin can be unwrapped. The presented method was tested over Datong coal mine, China, based on 16 TerraSAR-X acquisitions. The result suggests that the accuracy of time-series displacements along the LOS direction solved from the unwrapped phases using the new PU method is 1.1 cm, indicating an improvement of 73.2% compared with that of using the traditional MCF method.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

Besides, the derived deformation along one line-of-sight (LOS) direction can result in the misunderstanding of the real kinematics landslide process. In this study, we combine the multi-temporal distributed scatterer InSAR technology (DS-InSAR) and the multi-platform SAR measurements to derive the multi-dimension deformation time series of Zongling landslides. First, both ALOS/PALSAR-2 datasets and Sentinel-1A images from ascending and descending orbits are employed to acquire the deformation along the LOS direction using the DS-InSAR method, where dense effective targets can be achieved, and the deformation patterns can be revealed. Then, the multi-dimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) method is used to retrieve the horizontal and vertical deformation of Zongling landslides, which further improve the temporal sampling of the deformation time series. Finally, the comprehensive analyses of driving factors and failure mode are conducted according to the spatial–temporal deformation characteristics, and field investigation. The results indicate that this technical route can not only retrieve the landslide deformation with high spatial–temporal sampling density, but also provide new insight into the driven effect of natural factors and mining activities on karst landslides. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The Okgye limestone mine, which is the largest open-pit limestone mine located in a mountainous area in Korea, suffered a collapse in 2012 that claimed four casualties. Restoration work on the rocky mined-out slopes, as well as mining and dumping activities, are still in progress. Monitoring slope stability is important to prevent the sudden collapse of slopes, which can be efficiently performed by satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. Firstly, we obtained elevation changes using InSAR-generated Copernicus 30 m DEM in 2014 and an SRTM 1Sec DEM in 2000, through which the area was roughly classified into the mining area, tailings storage area, and the mined-out area. A time series of 12-day coherence images produced by Sentinel-1B SAR were averaged annually to produce an RGB-composite image to observe the change in mining activities during 2018, 2019, and 2020. We found many persistent scatterers (PS) when observing the ground displacement, both in the ascending and descending orbits, from which we decomposed this into the vertical and east components. The largest displacement of 63.6 mm/year was observed during 2019 and 2020 in the tailings storage area in the direction of the dumping slope. For the rocky outcrops and the transmission tower, we found a seasonal oscillation, which can be interpreted as the thermal expansion of limestone and iron. This paper demonstrated that the surface stability and deformation of open-pit mines could be effectively monitored by combining InSAR DEM, coherence, and PSInSAR techniques. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In order to prevent landslide and collapse in the mining area, it is essential not only to gain a full understanding of the surface deformation information about the open-pit mining area and surrounding dumps, but also to closely monitor the development of surface deformation. Small baseline set (SBAS) technology can be applied to extract the high-resolution spatial-temporal deformation information from the mining areas. Due to decoherence, however, it is difficult to obtain the effective information on deformation from some areas where the results are monitored. This paper proposes a kriging interpolation method that performs better in filling the missing values in the InSAR monitored results by integrating GPS measured data with InSAR monitored data. In the experimental process, 69 Sentinel-1 image data were collected from July 2018 to November 2020. The SBAS-InSAR technology was applied to monitor the surface deformation caused to the Kunyang phosphate mining area and surrounding dumping sites. It was found out that all the mining areas across the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine and the surrounding dumps suffered severe surface deformation, with the maximum line of sight (LOS) deformation rate of −132 mm/yr located in the dump in the north of the second mining area. The verification result shows that InSAR measurement results are consistent with the deformation estimated from GPS measurements. The root mean square error of most points is maintained within ±10 mm. The Kriging interpolation results of fusion GPS data are in good agreement with the GPS results. The root mean square errors at the 4 verification points are ±6.2 mm, ±4.6 mm, ±6.4 mm, ±7.8 mm. The method proposed in this paper is effective in filling in the missing values in the incoherent area, and can be applied to mine surface deformation monitoring with high reliability. The results of this paper serve as a scientific basis for the prevention and control of landslides, collapses and other hidden risks of geological disasters posed by the mining operations conducted in the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine. © 2022 COSPAR},

	abstract = {Non-eruptive uplift and subsidence episodes remain a challenge for monitoring and hazard assessments in active volcanic systems worldwide. Sources of such deformation may relate to processes such as magma inflow and outflow, motion and phase changes of hydrothermal fluids or magma volatiles, heat transfer from magmatic bodies and heat-mining from geothermal extraction. The Hengill area, in southwest Iceland, hosts two active volcanic systems, Hengill and Hrómundartindur, and two high-temperature geothermal power plants, Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir. Using a combination of geodetic data sets (GNSS and InSAR; Global Navigation Satellite Systems and Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar, respectively) and a non-linear inversion scheme to estimate the optimal analytical model parameters, we investigate the ground deformation between 2017–2018. Due to other ongoing deformation processes in the area, such as plate motion, subsidence in the two geothermal production fields, and deep-seated source of contraction since 2006, we estimate 2017–2018 difference velocities by subtracting background deformation, determined from data spanning 2015–2017 (InSAR) or 2009–2017 (GNSS). This method highlights changes in ground deformation observed in 2017–2018 compared to prior years: uplift signal of ∼10 km diameter located in the eastern part of the Hengill area, and geothermal production-related temporal changes in deformation near Húsmúli, in the western part of the Hengill area. We find an inflation source located between the Hengill and Hrómundartindur volcanic complexes, lasting for ∼5 months, with a maximum uplift of ∼12 mm. Our model inversions give a source at depth of ∼6–7 km, located approximately in the same crustal volume as an inferred contracting source in 2006–2017, within the local brittle-ductile transition zone. No significant changes were observed in local seismicity, borehole temperatures and pressures during the uplift episode. These transient inflation and deflation sources are located ∼3 km NW from a source of non-eruptive uplift in the area (1993–1999). We consider possible magmatic and hydrothermal processes as the causes for these inflation-deflation episodes and conclude that further geophysical and geological studies are needed to better understand such episodes. © Copyright © 2021 Ducrocq, Geirsson, Árnadóttir, Juncu, Drouin, Gunnarsson, Kristjánsson, Sigmundsson, Hreinsdóttir, Tómasdóttir and Blanck.},

	abstract = {Surface deformation data can be used to provide early warnings of geohazards and are useful in a variety of research fields. The Small BAseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) boosts the data sampling rate and improves the accuracy of deformation extraction by restricting the temporal and spatial baselines. However, various factors, such as the types of ground objects and seasons, affect the coherence between SAR images. Traditional SBAS-InSAR employs a fixed temporal baseline, which does not guarantee good coherence and might lead to decorrelation. In this paper, we propose that instead of using a fixed temporal baseline, we directly use the average coherence between SAR images as the baseline constraint index to perform an optimized selection of SBAS-InSAR interferometric pairs, ensuring good coherence of the interferometric pairs and improving the quality of the interferometric fringes. The proposed approach was used to extract surface deformation in two test experiment areas: Houston and Sydney. Compared with the conventional SBAS-InSAR and GPS data, the standard deviation of error of Houston and Sydney dropped from 0.813 to 0.589 and 0.291 to 0.246, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 1.082 to 1.041 and 0.485 to 0.334, respectively, indicating that the proposed method has better surface deformation extraction accuracy. After demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method, it was applied to Pingxiang area, a mining city in China, to effectively extract and analyze the surface deformation induced by mining activities, which proves the universality of this method in different scenarios. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Intensive and large-scale underground coal mining has caused geological disasters such as local ground subsidence, cracks and collapse in the Datong coalfield, China, inducing serious threats to local residents. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the capability of surface deformation detection with high precision in vast mountainous areas. DInSAR, stacking-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR are commonly used InSAR-related deformation analysis methods. They can provide effective support for mine ecological security monitoring and prevent disasters. We use the three methods to conduct the deformation observation experiments in the Datong coalfield. Sentinel-1A data from November 2020 to October 2021 are used. As a result, a total of 256 deformations in the Datong coalfield were successfully detected by the three methods, of which 218 are mining deformations, accounting for 85% of the total deformations. By comparing the results of the three methods, we found that DInSAR, stacking-InSAR, and SBAS-InSAR detected 130, 256, and 226 deformations in the Datong coalfield, respectively, while the deformations caused by coal mining were 128, 218, and 190. DInSAR results with long spatiotemporal baselines are seriously incoherent. SBAS-InSAR results of displacement rate are more precise than stacking-InSAR, and the mean standard deviation is 1.0 mm/a. However, for areas with lush vegetation or low coherence, SBAS-InSAR has poor performance. The detection deformation area results of DInSAR and SBAS-InSAR are subsets of stacking-InSAR. The displacement rates obtained by stacking-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR are consistent; the mean difference in the displacement rate between the two methods is 2.7 mm/a, and the standard deviation is 5.1 mm/a. The mining deformation locations and their shapes in the study area can be identified with high efficiency and power by stacking-InSAR. Therefore, with a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations of the three methods, stacking-InSAR can be an effective and fast method to identify the level, location and range of mining deformation in lush mountainous areas. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Horizontal strains related to mining‐induced subsidence may endanger infrastructure and surface users’ safety. While directional horizontal strains should be well determined, appropriate solutions for a complete assessment of the terrain surface deformation field are still required. As a result, the presented study examined a new method for calculating horizontal strain tensor based on the decomposition of satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) observations into vertical and azimuth look direction (ALD) displacements. Based on a geometric integral model, we tested our method on experimental data before applying it to an underground copper ore mine in Poland. In the case study, the displacement field was determined using the Multi‐Temporal InSAR method on Sentinel‐1 data. The model data relative error did not exceed 0.02 at σ = ±0.003. For the case study, land subsidence of up to −167 mm and ALD displacements ranging from −110 mm to +62 mm was obtained, whereas the extreme values of horizontal strains ranged from −0.52 mm/m to +0.36 mm/m at σ = ±0.050 mm/m. Our results demonstrate the high accuracy of the method in determining the horizontal strain tensor. As a result, the approach can broaden the assessment of the environmental impact of land subsidence worldwide. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

More specifically, we first investigated the geomorphological features and the time series subsidence rates across this slope from December 7, 2015 to April 26, 2019, by exploiting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) monitoring, we then analyzed the deformation characteristics, active zonation, and secondary landslide risk of the study area by integrating geological, engineering, and rainfall data. Finally, we discussed reasonable evolution sequence and potential risk of the landslide and provided several suggestions for subsequent geological hazard prevention.

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has been widely used in landslide deformation monitoring in the past decade. It has the advantages of high monitoring accuracy, a wide range, and flexibility allowing all-weather continuous monitoring. The self-developed S-SAR synthetic aperture radar (slope radar) is the first completely domestic-made radar used in slope deformation monitoring equipment in China, and its performance and technical parameters are equal to or better than similar products made abroad. The characteristics of deformation data collected by S-SAR slope radar deployed in the front open pit mine are analyzed to further develop a spatio-temporal landslide prediction method which is applicable to the massive monitoring data within the monitoring range of slope radar. The intersection points of short-term moving average velocity curve and long-term moving average velocity curve of slope deformation, which are onset of acceleration (OOA) and termination of acceleration (TOA). When OOA occurs, the deformation will accelerate, and when TOA occurs, the deformation will tend to stabilize. The OOA can identify areas at risk in the monitored area before failure, so that the spatial position prediction of landslide early warning can be realized. Based on the assumptions of the inverse velocity method, a T-log (t) logarithmic model is established, and the updated monitoring data are corrected to approximate the time of failure, thus improving the accuracy of landslide location and time prediction. In an open-pit copper mine in Serbia, the accurate prediction of landslide location and time has been successfully applied, guaranteeing safe mining. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The ability to monitor and predict slope failures in a surface mining setting is paramount for safely executing economically feasible open pit slope designs. Ground-based monitoring systems have proven to be effective for decades; however, with the geographical extensive nature of some mineral deposits, multiple open pit mining operations typically incur additional challenges of deploying and maintaining ground-based systems (compared with a single, large open pit). Monitoring strategies in the 2020s have significant opportunity to integrate satellite based InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) as part of the control measures depending on the expected failure mechanisms and risk profile. This paper uses case studies to explore the practical application of InSAR to ‘unveil unknowns’ for multiple open pit mining operations where ground monitoring capacity was previously constrained. Case studies include the retrospective analysis of historic slope failures, improving understanding of existing geotechnical hazards and improving engineering geological and slope stability models based on real slope performance data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The western part of Guizhou is located in the second step of East Asia. Although the area is stratigraphically continuous and the surface is dominated by hard limestone and sandstone, catastrophic landslides often occur, seriously threatening residents' lives and the safety of property. Accurate identification of landslides and analysis of their developmental patterns are vital to prevent and reduce the threat of geological disasters. No active landslide survey data cover this region, so this paper identifies the active landslides in the western part of Guizhou by combining surface deformation information, multitemporal optical remote sensing images, geological lithology, and geomorphic features to obtain deformation information from multisource synthetic aperture radar surface data. This process increases the accuracy and reliability of identifying unstable slopes in areas with dense vegetation and steep terrain. By processing 283 Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar data, 578 active landslides, 18 of which are high-risk large-scale landslides (landslide groups), are delineated for the first time in a range of 4.64 × 104 km2 in the study area. The active landslides mainly include natural landslides, reservoir landslides, and mining-induced landslides, accounting for 2.4%, 4.2 %, and 93.4%, respectively. The spatial distribution of landslides is banded along the cuesta at the edge of an outcrop of coal strata. Landslides are mainly distributed at elevations of 1800–2000 m, with an elevation difference of 50 ~ 100 m and a slope range of 35° ~ 40°. The landslides are characterized by steep slopes, small scales, mass occurrences, and no dominant slope direction, classifying them as cuesta landslides induced by mining disturbance. Furthermore, nuanced remote sensing interpretation of the disaster elements, such as cuesta cliff, tensile cracks, deep and sizeable tensile channels, isolated rock masses, and collapse debris, and their processes of change, reveals that coal mining-disturbed landslides in this region have experienced four primary stages: natural unloading, mining disturbance, displacement acceleration, and slope failure. This is of great significance for understanding the genetic mechanism and developmental patterns, as well as the risk assessment, of this region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Land surface deformation created by mining activities can have negative impacts on the environment. Measuring them can be a tool for managing the environmental impacts of mining. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry is a remote sensing method for measuring deformations. The main aim of this research is to investigate the deformation phenomenon on a region scale and extend our understanding of it to all mining deformation areas across the country. This paper used Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar technology to obtain deformations information in the Sangan mine based on mining activities. We used 48 scenes of Single Look Complex (SLC) data acquired by the Sentinel-1A, C-band of the European Space Agency descending orbit paths from 2014 to 2020. The Time Series of SBAS results show that the deformation velocity rate is about ¡20 to ¡35 mm/yr, and the displacement is attributed to approximately ¡120 mm in the Line of Sight direction. The main deformation zone is situated in the mining area on the main alluvial fan. This study presented the relationship between deformations and mining activity's effects on the ground. Mining activities were accompanied by ground deformation in the mining area: the ground deformation is exacerbated by the increasing mining quantity, and as a result will cause erosion, flood, and other geomorphologic phenomena in the area. We compared the results of the SBAS technique with leveling data for validating the data of SBAS. Their comparison shows approximately suitable agreement with the results of SBAS. © Central Mining Institute, Katowice, Poland.},

The uptake of this remote sensing technique however is geographically varying, and Australia has been one of many continents not fully utilizing the available InSAR data. As a result, limited knowledge exists on the application of InSAR data to obtain insights and benefits in geohazard risk monitoring and management. Due to the said limitation, this research carried out a concise technical background study and investigated a suite of case studies to demonstrate the potential for geohazard monitoring and assessment in Australia using InSAR. The differential InSAR workflow was applied to sites that experienced heaving and subsiding of the ground surface, mining, earthquake, landslides, and tunnelling in West Metro Melbourne (VIC), Musgrave (SA), Crinum mine (QLD), Pelham (TAS), Lake Muir (WA), and Sydney (NSW). The results of the Differential InSAR analysis resulted in acceptable ground movement and deformation estimates when compared with measured field data. Future opportunities related to new applications of the InSAR technique on geohazard reduction considering climate change contributions and probable coupling with artificial intelligence techniques were also discussed.

	abstract = {Accurately predicting large-scale surface displacements is a vital task in the prevention and control of geological hazards in mining areas. Small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) faces challenges in capturing significant deformations, and implementing extensive global navigation satellite system (GNSS) monitoring can only obtain a single point of deformation. To combine the strengths of both techniques, we proposed a novel approach named the LL-SIG (integrating single SBAS-InSAR pair, GNSS, and log-logistic model), which leverages the understanding of mining subsidence patterns and integrates single-orbit InSAR data with limited GNSS data to achieve overall and high-gradient 3-D deformation monitoring and prediction in mining areas. First, we employed empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) interpolation to integrate GNSS and SBAS-InSAR data at a consistent time interval. This allowed us to obtain an overall large-gradient deformation pattern of the mining area based on its subsidence characteristics. Subsequently, we combined the log-logistic model with the SIP (single InSAR pair) model to calculate the 3-D deformation resulting from mining activities at any moment. The proposed method was tested in the Fenxi Ruitai mine. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the fit deformation in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction was within 10% of the maximum deformation. Compared to the logistic model and Gompertz model, the log-logistic model shows superior accuracy and efficiency in mine deformation prediction under the same testing conditions. The RMSE of deformation for this method was 3.20, 5.85, and 3.73 cm in the vertical, northward, and eastward directions, respectively.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can obtain one-dimensional surface displacements in the radar line of sight (LOS). In the field of mining subsidence, large 3D movements often occur at the same time, and hence InSAR derived one-dimensional LOS displacements can hardly reflect the actual surface motion in mining areas. To realize the monitoring of three-dimensional large surface displacements in mining areas, a method for monitoring three-di-mensional large surface displacements in mining areas that combines SAR pixel offset tracking (OT) and an improved mining subsidence model is proposed in this article. First, a new functional relationship between surface subsidence and horizontal movement combined with the characteristics of the overburden rock stress and the deformation characteristics of the fractured rock mass in coal mining areas is established. Then, a three-dimensional surface deformation model is established based on the proposed relationship between surface subsidence and horizontal movement and the radar projection equation, and finally, the optimal parameters of the deformation model are in-verted iteratively using LOS deformation results obtained by OT method to retrieve the three-di-mensional large displacements of the surface. The significant advantage of the method proposed in this article is that it can accurately acquire the 3D large surface displacements using only two SAR amplitude images with the same imaging geometry. To verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed algorithm, two scenes of high-resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X images are used in this paper to conduct a three-dimensional surface displacement monitoring experiment on a working panel in the Daliuta mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, based on the proposed method. Experimental monitoring results show that the maximum surface subsidence is approximately 4.5 m, and the maximum horizontal movements in the strike and dip directions are approximately 1.4 m and 1.2 m, respectively. Using GPS measurements to verify the monitoring results, the root mean square error (RMSE) of vertical subsidence is 6.8 cm, and the RMSE of horizontal movement is 7.1 cm. Compared with those in the original mining subsidence model, the accuracies of vertical subsidence and horizontal movement in the proposed model are increased by 28.2% and 37.5%, respec-tively, which proves the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Ground deformation in the coal mining area of Northwestern China is usually featured by large and inconsistent subsidence. Large subsidence brings great challenge to Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and Permanent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technology due to the pixel-level offset in the range direction after co-registration, which could directly result in complete coherence loss even for the artificial Corner Reflectors (CRs). Offset tracking provides an alternative to capture the large deformation although the results could be biased due to the large deformation gradient and use of fixed correlation window size. In this paper, the point-like target (PT) offset tracking method is introduced to deformation monitoring in coal mining area with a levelly decreasing correlation window size. For each PT-centered SLC patch in the reference SAR image, the estimate from the larger correlation window will serve as a guide for the smaller one to locate the matching SLC patch in the slave SAR image, thus providing a guarantee that the residual offsets to be estimated remain to be a small fraction of the decreasing patch size. The offset estimates were evaluated by ground surveying results at 34 CRs obtained using single reference real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS technique, with a RMS error of 1/13-1/14 SLC pixel in both the range and azimuth directions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Coal is one of the fundamental fossil energy supporting the world’s economy. The synergistic development between efficient coal mining and ecological environment protection is the inevitable requirement for the preservation of global harmony. As the world’s largest coal producer, China has conducted a strategic shift from east to west in terms of the exploitation of its energy resources, posing a serious threat to the fragile ecological environment of the western region. In particular, the surface subsidence caused by coal mining is the root of the ecological deteriotation and the destruction of ground structures. However, it is difficult to reveal the law of large-scale surface subsidence in western mining areas merely by conventional measurement methods such as leveling, on account of the high intensity of coal seam mining, the weakness of the lithology of overlying rock and the large thickness of wind-blown sand strata. In view of this, small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology was used in this study to obtain the time series of surface vertical displacement during the whole mining process of the 2401 working face in the Yingpanhao coal mine, Inner Mongolia. Based on the deformation data, the dynamic evolution characteristics of surface subsidence under high intensity mining in the western mining area were analyzed exhaustively. It was found that the surface subsidence is characterized by an extensive coverage range (48.52 km2) with minimal ground settlement (250 mm) in the study area. Meanwhile, the boundary shape of the subsidence basin followed a “circular-parallelogram-trapezoid” changeable process and the coverage area of the basin experienced three stages: a linear increasing period, a temporary stagnation period, and a re-expansion period. Furthermore, there existed an abnormal uplift phenomenon on the east side of the open-off cut in the 2401 working face. Combined with the structure of overlying strata, this paper carried out a preliminary analysis on the reasons of the abovementioned phenomenon. The research results are of vital realistic significance for ground buildings and ecological environmental protection in the aeolian sand mining area in Western China. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the period between December 2018 and July 2019, a series of earthquakes (EQs), including the 16 December 2018 Ms 5.7 Xingwen mainshock and the 17 June 2019 Ms 6.0 Changning mainshock, struck the Changning shale gas exploration field in the southern margin of the Sichuan Basin. The Xingwen and Changning EQs both occurred on concealed faults, which led to hundreds of casualties, and affected a total of over 160 thousand people in southern Sichuan. The aftershock sequences following the Xingwen and Changning EQs were clustered in the vicinity of the Jianwu syncline and Changning anticline, respectively, and occurred mostly at depths of 3–7 km. In this study, coseismic surface deformation measurements obtained through differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) data were used to identify the faulting geometries and distributions. The coseismic deformation maps have maximum line-of-sight (LOS) displacements of ∼4.53 cm on the northwest side of the Xingwen EQ source fault and ∼7.84 cm on the southwest side of the Changning EQ source fault. The calculated static Coulomb stress changes indicated that most aftershocks occurred in increasing stress zones following the mainshock ruptures. From the InSAR deformation field, a complicated concealed seismogenic doublet fault was inferred, which predominately exhibited left-lateral strike-slip motion during the Xingwen and Changning EQs. The footwall ramp of the basement fault reactivated first, and resulted in the Xingwen EQ and concentrating stresses beneath the Changning anticline, which induced the Changning EQ half a year later. Compared with previous studies, we proposed that the fault network was lubricated by water that was injected during shale gas exploration, facilitating the occurrence of the Xingwen and Changning EQs. Such work evaluated the coseismic deformations of the Xingwen and Changning EQs, and derived the regional faulting distribution from aftershock sequences. It could provide useful information for monitoring and analyzing seismic activity around the hinge zones of folds in mining exploration areas, which contributes to effective risk assessment of disasters associated with seismic geo-environments.

	abstract = {The historical Ukrainian rock-salt mining town of Solotvyno and its environmentally related problems are well-known. A complex monitoring system is needed to evaluate the current situation in order to revitalize the investigated area. In addition to other risks, surface deformation due to undermining is one of the major risks endangering building infrastructure in the inhabited area of the town. These processes are well-known in the area, and damages caused by the surface movement are often recognized. Measurement of the process’s intensity and identification of the impacted area are crucial for any revitalization work. Information on these processes is the most important element of the hazard management and spatial-developmental planning of the town. This study aimed to characterize the long-term surface deformation processes and to identify the spatial and temporal trends and changes of these processes to assist spatial planning. The first step was to understand the surface deformation history from 1992. An InSAR-based assessment of the surface displacement of the undermined Solotvyno area was performed using data from three satellites, namely the ERS, Envisat, and the Sentinel-1, covering the time period between 1992 and 2021. The derived quantitative analysis indicated an intensive surface displacement and subsidence over the mining area. However, these displacements have not been even in the last 30 years of the investigation. The identification of the stabilized areas and recently started movements indicated the dislocation of the processes, which requires adequate actions for geohazard management and strategic planning. The demonstrated technology (InSAR) has the potential to set up an appropriate alarm system and provides an automated mechanism for continuous risk detection. A complex systems development is able to significantly reduce the geohazards over the unstable built-up zones. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the largest mid-to low latitude and high-altitude permafrost. Open-pit coal mining and other activities have caused serious damage to the alpine ecological environment and have accelerated the degradation of permafrost on the QTP. In this study, the influence of open-pit coal mining on the time series ground surface deformation of the permafrost in the Muli region of the QTP was analyzed from 19 January 2018 to 22 December 2020 based on Landsat, Gaofen, and Sentinel remote sensing data. The primary methods include human-computer interactive visual interpretation and the small baseline subsets interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of displacement velocity exhibits a considerably different pattern in the Muli region. Alpine meadow is the main land use/land cover (LULC) in the Muli region, and the surface displacement was mainly subsidence. The surface subsidence trend in alpine marsh meadows was obvious, with a subsidence displacement velocity of 10–30 mm/a. Under the influence of changes in temperature, the permafrost surface displacement was characteristics of regular thaw subsidence and freeze uplift. Surface deformation of the mining area is relatively severe, with maximum uplift displacement velocity of 74.31 mm/a and maximum subsidence displacement velocity of 167.51 mm/a. Open-pit coal mining had resulted in the destruction of 48.73 km2 of natural landscape in the Muli region. Mining development in the Muli region had increased the soil moisture of the alpine marsh meadow around the mining area, resulting in considerable cumulative displacement near the mining area and the acceleration of permafrost degradation. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Accurately locating goafs is critical for identifying illegal mining, preventing mining-related geohazards, and facilitating the development and utilization of underground spaces. Conventional methods for locating goafs with InSAR techniques primarily rely on the probability integral model (PIM), which tends to overestimate the ground deformation under subcritical extraction. On the other hand, the number of subcritical extraction working faces significantly rises with mining depth. Under these circumstances, accurately locating subcritical underground goafs using existing methods becomes challenging. To this end, a novel method, which incorporates the improved PIM (IPIM) and InSAR technique for locating subcritical goafs, is proposed, named the locating goaf method based on IPIM (LGM-IPIM). First, based on the IPIM, a model between the subcritical goaf parameters and InSAR-derived deformation is built. Then, to reduce the influence of the surrounding mining, the goaf azimuth angle is determined with textures and patterns of the InSAR-derived deformation time series. Finally, the genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) is used to determine the goafs' parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified by simulation and real data. The results demonstrate that the proposed LGM-IPIM outperforms conventional methods, presenting the best performance and the highest accuracy. Specifically, compared with the LGM based on PIM (LGM-PIM), the proposed LGM-IPIM improves the location accuracy of goaf boundary points by 28.90% and 86.23% in Areas A and B, respectively. In addition, the proposed LGM-IPIM has robustness against minor errors within deformation monitoring and IPIM parameters. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A catastrophic rock avalanche from a tableland escarpment occurred at the Pusa village, Guizhou Province, southwest (SW) China, causing 35 fatalities and huge economic losses. The steep slope lies in the Longtan Formation coal-bearing shale of Permian, which is widely distributed in SW China. It was overlaid by brittle superstrata in Triassic and followed by gently anticline tectonic movement in Cenozoic, thus forming large-scale tableland escarpments with an “upper brittle, lower ductile” structure. Affected by underground coal mining activity at the base, this escarpment has become unstable and prone to failure. In order to further clarify the geological conditions and other influence factors for the Pusa landslide, we propose a newly improved multiple Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), named average-DInSAR, to detect the displacements on escarpments in a broad region. Extensive experimental results show that there existed obvious pre-failure displacements on the swarming escarpments, evidencing their unstable state, which were verified by field inspection. The spatiotemporal correlation analysis suggests that this abnormal deformation is probably induced by underground coal mining in the vicinity. Further confirming that the special geological conditions and nearby coal mining activity were responsible for the 2017 Pusa rock avalanche. Our study also demonstrates that the average-DInSAR method is simple and effective, which can overcome low coherence and noise of DInSAR, especially for shorter X- or C-band SAR data. Application of proposed method would permit to detect displacement before slope failure with higher re-visiting frequency, thus helping define early warning strategies for landslides in area with similar geological conditions. © 2021},

First, we exploit a speckle tracking (ST) approach to derive the easting, northing, and vertical components of the displacement vectors across the rock slope for two five‐year windows, 2010–2015 and 2015–2020. Then, we perform post‐processing in a GIS environment to derive displacement magnitude, trend, and plunge maps of the landslide area. Finally, we compare the ST‐derived displacement data with structural lineament maps and profiles extracted from the ALS dataset. Relying on remotely sensed data, we estimate that the thickness of the slide mass is more than 100 m and displacements occur through a combination of slumping at the toe and planar sliding in the central and upper slope. Our approach provides information and interpretations that can assist in optimizing and planning fieldwork activities and site investigations at landslides in remote locations. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Mountain-Oasis-Desert System (MODS) is the fundamental landscape component within the vast arid region of Central Asia. Human activities and natural processes cause surface displacement in the MODS, resulting in geoenvironmental issues and hazards. However, surface displacement and its driving mechanisms in the MODS are not understood. In this study, we used the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method to detect deformation in the MODS in north Tianshan Mountain, Xinjiang and investigated its attribution from the geological conditions, groundwater level changes, and climate variability. The results along the vertical gradient indicate that decorrelation is severe in the high mountain areas with ice-marginal environments (over 3600 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) and the forest-covered mid-mountainous belt (1700–2800 m asl), rendering effective detection unfeasible. Dynamic characteristics are identified in subalpine areas with an elevation of 2800–3600 m asl, with maximum horizontal and vertical displacements of −80.2 mm/year and −58.6 mm/year, respectively. The seasonal acceleration is influenced by the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes. We observed dense subsidence funnels and ground fissures associated with coal mining in the foreland hills (700–1700 m asl). Ground displacements here exceeded −50 mm/year two years after mining activities had ceased. Subsidence has expanded in the oases with elevations of less than 700 m asl, due to extensive groundwater extraction for agricultural irrigation. The correlation coefficient between groundwater level and displacement was 0.89 and 0.45 at wells in the agricultural and desert areas, respectively. The deformation exhibited seasonal variations associated with groundwater level. The deformation remains relatively stable in the surrounding oasis-affected desert areas, with weak fluctuations influenced by seasonal variations in groundwater level. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {It is a common method to resolve three-dimensional (3-D) deformation components associated with underground mining by incorporating Single-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) with a prior deformation model termed linear proportion model (LPM) (hereinafter referred to as Sin-LPM). Nevertheless, the Sin-LPM method relies on three model parameters that are needed to be in situ collected, and it neglects their dynamic changes during the period of underground extraction, narrowing the practical applications of the Sin-LPM method, and degrading the accuracy of the estimated 3-D displacements. In this article we propose a new method to resolve 3-D mining displacements from multi-track InSAR observations by incorporating with the LPM. In which, the model parameters are first considered as dynamic and further adaptively estimated from the multi-track InSAR observations using a robust solver. Following that, 3-D mining displacements are resolved from the multi-track InSAR using the conjugate gradient method (CGM). The proposed method was tested in Datong coalfield, China. The results suggest that the proposed method can well estimate 3-D mining displacements with a mean error of about 1.8 cm. Compared with the previous Sin-LPM, the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of the estimated 3-D displacements (e.g., 69% in this study), and can work well even over a large area where the model parameters are unknown. The proposed method offers a new insight to improve the InSAR-based retrieval of 3-D displacements induced by other anthropologic or geophysical activities. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, salt diapirs have been widely used for gas storing, hazardous waste disposal, mining, and petroleum production. The rate and pattern of active movement in salt structures are crucial to be obtained before planning these industrial utilizations. The central basin of the Iranian plateau represents well-exposed and -preserved diapirs that can be considered as an analog for other salt basins around the world where the exposures are not as good. Integration of the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique with remote-sensing structural mapping permits us to study the active surficial deformation of eight salt diapirs in the Kalut basin in central Iran. We classify the Kalut diapiric structures into salt walls, massifs, stocks, and welds. We then use 75 Single Look Complex (SLC) IW scenes acquired on the ascending collected from November 2014 to November 2018 and 62 SLC images on descending geometries collected from October 2014 to January 2018, both covering the same period. The Sentinel-1 images are processed by the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approaches to define vertical and horizontal displacement maps revealing that the Kalut basin is one of the most-active present-day diapiric systems in the world, its eight salt diapirs are rising, and none of them subsides. Maximum calculated rates of growth reach 8 mm/yr in vertical and ~ 2 mm/yr in horizontal directions, suggesting that in general vertical displacements play a significant role in the deformation of this salt-controlled basin. Salt stocks are uniformly rising in their crestal domain (up to 8 mm/yr) with lateral spreading along their flanks (1–2 mm/yr). The larger salt walls are more active and rising faster (8 mm/yr) than smaller ones (3 mm/yr), while welded areas are inactive. These rising salt diapirs are flanked by seasonal depocenters accumulating up to 10 mm/yr of fluvial, evaporitic, and aeolian deposits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Open access to SAR data from the Sentinel 1 missions allows analyses of long-term ground surface changes. The current data-acquisition frequency of 12 days facilitates the continuous monitoring of phenomena such as volcanic and tectonic activity or mining-related deformations. SAR data are increasingly also used as input data in forecasting phenomena on the basis of machine learning. This article presents the possibility of using selected machine learning algorithms in forecasting the influence of underground mining activity on the ground surface. The study was performed for a mining protective area with a surface of over 500 km (Formula presented.) and located in western Poland. The ground surface displacements were calculated for the period from November 2014 to July 2021, with the use of the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method. The forecasts were performed for a total of 22 identified subsidence troughs. Each of the troughs was provided with two profiles, with a total of more than 10,000 identified points. The selected algorithms served to prepare 180-day displacement forecasts. The best results (significantly better than the baseline) were obtained with the ARIMA and Holt models. Linear models also provided better results than the baseline and their performance was very good at up to 2 months forecasting. Tree-based models including their sophisticated ensemble versions: bagging (Random Forest, Extra Trees) and boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, Hist Gradient Boosting) cannot be used for this type of predictions since Decision Trees are not able to extrapolate and thus are not a valid stand-alone tool for forecasting in this type of problems. A combination of satellite remote sensing data and machine learning facilitated both the simultaneous quasi-permanent monitoring of ground surface displacements and their forecasting in a relatively long time period. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Surface subsidence caused by coal mining has a great impact on the geological and ecological environments and causes damage to houses, roads, and industrial buildings. In order to understand the subsidence pattern in the mountainous mining regions, three mining faces of the Zhangjiamao mining area in the north of Shaanxi province, northwestern China are taken as case study. Firstly, the small baseline subset (SBAS) technology is used to process 12 images obtained in the mining area to investigate the subsidence data from December 2019 to April 2020. The boundary of surface deformation of the mining area interpreted by the SBAS-InSAR technology is inconsistent with the theoretical boundary suggested by coal mine subsidence theories. Especially, there are some areas in which the real subsidence are larger than estimated area. This discrepancy must be corrected as steep slopes near the theoretical boundary may increase the likelihood of landslides. Our research indicates that: (1) The accumulated displacement and the maximum deformation rate reached −120.759 mm and −270.012 mm/yr in the study area, and the subsidence boundary of the three mining faces is revealed; (2) the combination of the predicted boundary and slope stability analysis can effectively identify the landslide region at the edge of subsidence boundary; (3) the field surveys have proved the effectiveness of this method. The mining area subsidence revealed by our research helps to further understand the impact of land subsidence caused by mining in the mountainous areas and provides a practical method to predict subsidence boundaries and the likelihood for landslides. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Landslides or landslide-induced impact waves in high mountain lakes represent a high hazard for society, calling for realistic assessments of rock slope stability responsible for the process chain initiation. This task is often hampered by complex interplays of triggers, which effects on slope stability may be delayed by decades or even millennia, while historical records describing slope topography or landslide occurrences are usually shorter and incomplete. This article builds on rarely available detailed historical data describing the site of the 2002 rock avalanche in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru. It caused a dangerous impact wave in the Safuna Alta Lake resulting in a minor flood, but ongoing downstream development significantly increased the risk of a comparable event. Pre-2002 and post-2002 failure slope topography, 70 years long history of glaciation and landslide occurrences were combined with non-invasive field geological surveys and laboratory geotechnical analyses to characterize the distinct morphological parts of the failed slope with reliable engineering geological slope models. Slope stability was calculated for a series of environmental scenarios providing insights into the 2002 rock avalanche failure mechanism and dynamics as well as the role of glacier slope support for its stability. Results show that the rock slope stability is governed by discontinuous slip planes where rock bridges represent the most likely additional resisting forces. The effect of glacier support on the slope stability is limited under full-water saturation of the rocks and due to specific morpho-structural conditions. Importance of the long-term, progressive deterioration of the rock slope strength under paraglacial environment and repeated seismic shaking is illustrated by the fact that even the Little Ice Age maximum glacier extend only had minor positive effect on the pre-2002 rock avalanche slope stability. Despite of that, the slope remained without a major failure for decades or possibly even centuries. Its collapse in 2002 caused retrogressive movements of the adjacent slope, which remains highly unstable until now. Therefore the future safety of the lake would largely benefit from the implementation of a reliable slope movement monitoring system. © Copyright © 2021 Klimeš, Novotný, Rapre, Balek, Zahradníček, Strozzi, Sana, Frey, René, Štěpánek, Meitner and Junghardt.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas is the basis of studying the mining subsidence law and obtaining surface movement parameters. The traditional multi-tem-poral interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can only obtain the surface deformation in line-of-sight (LOS) direction, even if some methods can obtain the 3-D displacements of mining area based on InSAR. However, it has high data requirements for data types, which are not conducive to the inversion of 3-D displacements. In this paper, the symmetry of the surface basin caused by mining subsidence under different mining degrees is analyzed. According to the basic symmetrical features of mining subsidence—that the surface vertical displacement and horizontal displacement in near horizontal coal seam is symmetrical with respect to the main section of the basin, combined with time series InSAR technology (TS-InSAR)—a novel method for retrieving the 3-D displacement results from a single-geometry InSAR dataset based on symmetrical features (hereafter referred to as the SGI-SF method) is proposed. The SGI-SF method first generates multi-temporal observations of LOS displacement from a single-geometry InSAR dataset, and then trans-forms them into multi-temporal observations of 3-D displacement datasets according to symmetrical features. There is no necessity to obtain the surface movement parameters from the measured data to calculate 3-D displacement fields. Finally, the time series of 3-D displacements are estimated from multi-temporal 3-D displacements using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Nine descending Sentinel-1 images from the Yulin mining area of China are used to test the proposed SGI-SF method. The results show that the average root mean square errors (RMSE) in the vertical and horizontal direction of the three-dimensional deformations are approximately 9.28 mm and 13.10 mm, respectively, which are much smaller than mining-induced displacements and can provide support for deformation monitoring in mining areas. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The cessation of dewatering following coalfield abandonment results in the rise of minewater, which can create significant changes in the local and regional hydrogeological regime. Monitoring such change is challenging but essential to avoiding detrimental consequences such as groundwater contamination and surface flooding. Inverse modelling methods using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) have proven capable for retrospectively mapping minewater level changes, however, there is a need for the capability to remotely monitor changes as they occur. In this study, ground deformation measurements obtained from InSAR are used to develop a method to remotely monitor the spatio-temporal rise of minewater, which could be implemented in near real-time. The approach is demonstrated over the Horlivka mining agglomeration, Ukraine, where there is no other feasible approach possible due to a lack of safe ground access. The results were blindly validated against in-situ measurements before being used to forecast the time until minewater will reach the natural water table and Earth's surface. The findings reveal that, as a result of military conflict in Donbas, an environmental catastrophe could occur where potentially radioactive minewater is forecast to reach the natural water table between May and August of 2024. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Luanchuan mining area, which is located in Henan Province, China and characterized by undulating topography and large precipitation, is vulnerable to the landslide disasters. The observations from the space-borne radar (ascending and descending TerraSAR-X) images and the ground-based radar (GPRI-II) images are integrated to monitor the surface deformations in Luanchuan mining area. Before the integration of the observations from multi-source SAR images, the coordinate systems of multi-source images are required to be unified by geographical projection. However, the accuracy of the commonly used geographical coding will be degraded by external DEM errors and inaccurate satellite orbit, which makes it difficult to achieve the high-precision registration of space-borne and ground-based radar scenes. Therefore, in this paper the iterative closest point (ICP) method is introduced to register the space-borne and ground-based images, yielding sub-pixel registration accuracy. Reasonable weights are then assigned to multi-source observations through Strain Model and Variance Component Estimation (SM-VCE) method, from which the high-precision three-dimensional deformations can be reconstructed. The results show that the maximum deformation rates in the east-west, north-south and vertical directions of Luanchuan mining area from July 20, 2019, to August 1, 2019, are about 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 mm/day, respectively. The deformations are mainly on the loose slags in the Luanchuan pit rather than the bedrock, as a result of the accumulation of waste slags. Some suggestions on the installation location of ground-based radar are also provided to better combine the space-borne and ground-based observations. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {A promised potential of spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radars (InSAR) is a capability for regularly monitoring ground deformation with millimeter accuracy, for timely forecasting of impending natural hazards such as landslides. The main limitation in InSAR being actually capable of unleashing this potential for hazard prediction is that key precursory ground displacements are, in the majority of cases, a very small subset of the entire big data set provided by the method over large regions. Consequently, pinpointing a single impending failure may become very difficult or impossible. We develop a data-driven framework that can handle such imbalanced spatiotemporal data based on the concept of outlying aspects mining, to find a subset of features out of a collection of potential features, which best distinguishes the landslide source area from the others. We show that the identified feature subspace can be used to find anomalous areas across multiple spatial scales, such that Sentinel-1 satellite monitoring points which persistently lie in these areas can accurately detect the location of the Xinmo landslide (China) almost 1 year in advance—without false alarms. In a second case study, we identify the area affected by rockfalls on Stromboli volcano, a task that is generally infeasible with traditional methods applied to InSAR data. With continuing improvements in the spatial and temporal resolution from the new generation of satellites, such as Sentinel-1, this approach opens the door to reliable and early prediction of failure over a broad range of slope instabilities. © 2022.

	abstract = {Surface subsidence caused by coal mining has become an important factor that affects and restricts the sustainable development of mining districts. It is necessary to use appropriate methods for effective subsidence monitoring. It is hard to monitor large gradient ground deformations with a high accuracy by using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technology. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is limited in that it monitors the basin edge by subtracting two DEMs (digital elevation models). Therefore, in this paper we propose a combination of DInSAR and UAV photogrammetry to complement the two data advantages and to achieve a high-precision monitoring of mining subsidence areas. The subsidence of coal panel 81,403 in the Yangquan coal mine was obtained using DInSAR and UAV photogrammetry technologies. The appropriate fusion points were selected for the two datasets and the agreement between the fusion data and the leveling data was verified. The results indicated that the combination of DInSAR and UAV technology could monitor the settlement more accurately than the single use of DInSAR or UAV technology. © 2022 by the authors.},

Deformation monitoring has been carried out with techniques, such as multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR). Over the past decade, MTInSAR has been widely used in monitoring mining deformation, and it is still difficult to retrieve mining deformation over dense vegetation areas. In this study, we use multiple-platform SAR images to retrieve mining deformation over dense vegetation areas. The high-quality interferograms are selected by the coherence map, and the mining deformation is retrieved by the MSBAS-InSAR technique. SAR images from TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A, Radarsat-2, and PALSAR-2 over the Fengfeng mining area, Heibei, China, are used to retrieve the deformation of mining activities covered with dense vegetation. The results show that the subsidence in the Fengfeng mining area reaches up to 90 cm over the period from July 2015 to April 2016.

	abstract = {A quarry failure along the slopes of the Wai Khar open-pit jade mine in Hpakant, Myanmar has led to the deaths of at least 172 jade miners on 2 July 2020. This paper conducts a systematic investigation of the incident by integrating data from multiple sensors, including high-resolution optical imagery, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, unmanned aerial system (UAS) footage, SRTM and ALOS digital elevation models (DEMs), soil moisture product from multi-spectral Landsat-8 satellite and precipitation records from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Optical imagery, UAS footage and DEMs allow us to build a comprehensive mapping of tailing areas and quarry scarps from 2010 and reconstruct the 2D pit geometry prior to failure. Deformation signals from multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR), soil moisture variations and precipitation trends further allow us to identify possible failure causes. To evaluate the quality of deformation obtained from different distributed-scatterer phase estimators, we develop an empirical mapping function based on areal fraction values to facilitate the comparison of temporal coherence values that are differently formulated in each phase estimator. The comparison shows that phase linking algorithm outperforms the small baseline subset method in terms of signal recovery and phase reliability. Our investigation points out that the mining site is under aggressive mining cycles that are exacerbated by frequent, uncontrolled landslides. Seepage failure, which involves the expulsion of water from rapidly compacting tailings, may be a critical factor in the 2020 incident. Instead of extreme weather, the failure had occurred under normal to drier conditions. This means that the sliding planes were already in a critical state, which is evident from the accelerated deformation around the collapse area since the beginning of 2020. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations to improve mining site regulations and management practices for safer open-pit mining in Myanmar and probably in similar contexts outside Myanmar. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Ground surface uplift was detected at the start of longwall mining, a significant part of which is situated in the shaft protection pillar Sever of the CSM Mine in the Czech Republic. The largest uplift was found to be 23 mm, by the levelling method of surface points with height connections to non-mined areas. Due to the length of the connection to the non-influenced area, precise levelling was chosen to observe the vertical displacements and prove the displacement values using a confidence interval with 5% risk. This article aims to clarify the cause of ground surface uplift during longwall mining. Therefore, the height changes of the given area were extracted also from satellite radar interferometry (InSAR). The changes of the observed ground surface were compared with the empirical subsidence. The largest difference between the measured and empirical surface subsidence was 85 mm and occurred in the period before the ground surface uplift. Spatiotemporal evaluation of the data was used to determine the presumed cause of the occurrence of surface uplift in the overburdened strata, due to previous mining activity and the subsequent unburdening of the rock mass.

	abstract = {Underground mining can produce subsidence, which can be coincident with mining activities or delayed in response to the time-dependent deformation of the rocks. Therefore, in these cases, it is essential to effectively monitor the soil deformations at different times during and after mining activity. In the present work, an integrated approach based on geotechnical numerical modeling and Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) method has been applied to detect, study and monitor the subsidence related to mining activity in the Nuraxi Figus coal district (Sardinia, Italy). Two datasets of high-resolution COSMO-Skymed images were acquired, respectively in two covering periods: from 2011 and 2014, and from 2013 to 2020. The A-DInSAR results show that the predominant displacement rates are located in correspondence with the panels. The cumulated satellite-based LoS displacements vary in the first period between − 130 and + 28 mm and − 293 and + 28.4 mm, while, during the second period between − 6.9 and + 1.6 mm and − 8.72 and + 4.33 mm in ascending and descending geometries, respectively. The geotechnical numerical model allowed to obtain a value for the maximum expected. By using the vertical and horizontal components it was possible to reconstruct the kinematics of the deformation considering three phases: pre-mining, syn-mining, and post-mining activity. The temporal evolution of displacements started during the mining extraction in 2011, achieved the major values in correspondence of post-mining operations, during the period from 2013 to 2014 and continued slowly until 2020. The near real-time monitoring system applied in this study proved to be very useful for detecting subsidence during the mining activity and the post-mining period. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Large slow rock-slope deformations, including deep-seated gravitational slope deformations and large landslides, are widespread in alpine environments. They develop over thousands of years by progressive failure, resulting in slow movements that impact infrastructures and can eventually evolve into catastrophic rockslides. A robust characterization of their style of activity is thus required in a risk management perspective. We combine an original inventory of slow rock-slope deformations with different PS-InSAR and SqueeSAR datasets to develop a novel, semi-automated approach to characterize and classify 208 slow rock-slope deformations in Lombardia (Italian Central Alps) based on their displacement rate, kinematics, heterogeneity and morphometric expression. Through a peak analysis of displacement rate distributions, we characterize the segmentation of mapped landslides and highlight the occurrence of nested sectors with differential activity and displacement rates. Combining 2D decomposition of InSAR velocity vectors and machine learning classification, we develop an automatic approach to characterize the kinematics of each landslide. Then, we sequentially combine principal component and K-medoids cluster analyses to identify groups of slow rock-slope deformations with consistent styles of activity. Our methodology is readily applicable to different landslide datasets and provides an objective and cost-effective support to land planning and the prioritization of local-scale studies aimed at granting safety and infrastructure integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The mining of coal resources in eastern China has entered the stage of deep mining, and many mines have reached the depth of 1000 meters. Different from shallow and moderate depth mining, the temporal and spatial evolution regulation of surface movement and deformation under deep mining has its particularity. Combining with the geological and mining conditions of Fengfeng mining area, this paper systematically studies the characteristics of surface movement under the condition of shallow, moderate, and near kilometer mining depth. By means of field measurement, InSAR monitoring, we get the subsidence data under different mining depth and get the relevant subsidence parameters by inversion. Through comparative analysis, the special law of subsidence under the mining depth of 1000 meters is obtained. The results show that under the condition of nearly 1000 meters mining depth, the surface movement and deformation have the characteristics of large displacement angle, small displacement deformation value, and large main influence radius. The regulation of small proportion of active period of maximum subsidence point, gentle shape of surface movement basin, and low mining adequacy are obtained. The research results provide technical references for deep mining under buildings, railways, and water bodies and provide basis and reference for scientific mining and safe recovery of coal pillars in kilometer deep mine.  © 2021 Yueguan Yan et al.},

	abstract = {Tailings dams are usually ponds bounded by valleys or surrounding topography to store mining or other chemical industrial waste. On 25 January 2019, the collapse of a tailings dam at the Córrego do Feijao iron ore mine (Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil) released about 12 million m3 of tailings, killing over 240 people and posing a considerable and ongoing environmental threat. The stability of tailings dam monitoring is very important and in the present paper, a new InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry) time series approach is proposed to derive ground displacement maps for use in dam safety monitoring. Compared with the other solutions, the unique feature of the proposed method is that: 1) the new Measurement Pixel (MP) selection criteria has the potential to include relatively more accurate MP pixels and build a more robust network, 2) the multi-level grading system makes it possible to add the MP pixels into the main network step-by-step with external control, and 3) the computing efficiency can be improved by strategically reducing the iteration times. The proposed approach was tested on both simulated and real data. Results show that the Simulated Annealing (SA) method normally has a more accurate estimation as compared to the Quasi-Newton (QN) method, despite its longer processing time. Detailed analysis of the displacement maps was conducted to determine the subsidence processes that result from dam construction. © 2020},

	abstract = {Coal-mining subsidence causes ground fissures and destroys surface structures, which may lead to severe casualties and economic losses. Time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) plays an important role in surface deformation detection and monitoring without the restriction of weather and sunlight conditions. In addition, the probability integral method (PIM) is a surface movement model that is widely used in the field of mining subsidence. In recent years, the integration of TS-InSAR and the PIM has been extensively studied. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate mining subsidence with the PIM based on TS-InSAR results. This study focuses on the improvement of a boundary constraint and dynamic parameter estimation in the PIM through the inversion of the line-of-sight (LOS) time series deformation derived by TS-InSAR. In addition, 45 Sentinel-1A images from 17 June 2015 to 27 December 2017 of a coal mine in Jiaozuo are utilized to acquire the surface displacement. We apply a time series deformation analysis using small baseline subsets (SBAS) and place the results into an improved PIM to estimate the mining parameters. The simulated mining subsidence is highly consistent with the leveling data, exhibiting an RMSE of 0.0025 m. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed method is more accurate in discovering displacement in mining areas. In the final section of this paper, some sources of error that affect the experiment are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Slope failures occur in open-pit mining areas worldwide, producing considerable damage in addition to economic loss. Identifying the triggering factors and detecting unstable slopes and precursory displacements —which can be achieved by exploiting remote sensing data— are critical for reducing their impact. Here we present a methodology that combines digital photogrammetry, satellite radar interferometry, and geo-mechanical modeling, to perform remote analyses of slope instabilities in open-pit mining areas. We illustrate this approach through the back analysis of a massive landslide that occurred in an active open-pit mine in southwest Spain in January 2019. Based on pre- and post-event high-resolution digital elevation models derived from digital photogrammetry, we estimate an entire sliding mass volume of around 14 million m3. Radar interferometry reveals that during the year preceding the landslide, the line of sight accumulated displacement in the slope reached − 5.7 and 4.6 cm in ascending and descending geometry, respectively, showing two acceleration events clearly correlated with rainfall in descending geometry. By means of 3D and 2D stability analyses we located the slope instability, and remote sensing monitoring led us to identify the likely triggers of failure. Las Cruces event can be attributed to delayed and progressive failure mechanisms triggered by two factors: (i) the loss of historical suction due to a pore-water pressure increase driven by rainfall and (ii) the strain-softening behavior of the sliding material. Finally, we discuss the potential of this methodological approach either to remotely perform post-event analyses of mining-related landslides and evaluate potential triggering factors or to remotely identify critical slopes in mining areas and provide pre-alert warning. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Unlike synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, SAR offset tracking method can measure two-dimensional (2-D) large-gradient deformation with precision as 1/10 to 1/30 pixels size. In terms of 2-D deformation time series estimation, the pixel-offset small baseline subset (PO-SBAS) method was proposed. However, little research has been conducted on the dynamic estimation of 2-D deformation time series for new SAR acquisitions, which has increasing demand with the availability of SAR data. In this letter, we introduced a novel method to update 2-D deformation time series dynamically under the frame of PO-SBAS. Firstly, complex least squares (CLS) method is derived to solve the complex linear function model, and the difference between the CLS estimation in complex value and the LS estimation in real value for the real and imaginary parts, respectively, are compared. Secondly, complex sequential least squares (CSLS) estimation is proposed to update 2-D deformation time series dynamically and efficiently. Finally, both simulated and real SAR data verified the performance of the proposed method. It can be taken as a promising SAR tool for dynamic 2-D deformation estimation for the scenarios of glacier movement, mining-induced displacement, and co-seismic deformation, etc. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Ground deformation caused by underground coal mining has a large subsidence gradient and high nonlinearity and may cause continuous destruction to the surface structure after mining. A synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful method for measuring and reconstructing the ground displacement. In this article, a total of 19 descending orbit X-band TerraSAR-X and 16 ascending orbit C-band Sentinel-1 images were integrated to monitor the ground displacement of a coal mining area in Yu County (Hebei Province, China) using a small baseline subset (SBAS-InSAR) algorithm. We found that the SBAS-InSAR technology can obtain reliable results in regions without a high gradient deformation by combining the deformation rates derived from both the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum subsidence rate was approximately 125 mm/y between 17 June 2015 and 07 January 2016. In the case of large-gradient deformation, it is indeed difficult to obtain the mining-induced surface subsidence information accurately using the conventional multitemporal (MT-InSAR) techniques owing to the limitations of the SAR wavelength. In response to this problem, a new decision-making fusion method based on SBAS-InSAR and offset tracking was developed to monitor the large-gradient settlement in mining areas. The results show that the method developed compensates for the shortcomings of the traditional MT-InSAR technologies in the field of large-gradient deformation and obtains reliable results.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The previously presented Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS-2D) technique computes two-dimensional (2D), east and vertical, ground deformation time series from two or more ascending and descending Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) data sets by assuming that the contribution of the north deformation component is negligible. DInSAR data sets can be acquired with different temporal and spatial resolutions, viewing geometries and wavelengths. The MSBAS-2D technique has previously been used for mapping deformation due to mining, urban development, carbon sequestration, permafrost aggradation and pingo growth, and volcanic activities. In the case of glacier ice flow, the north deformation component is often too large to be negligible. Historically, the surface-parallel flow (SPF) constraint was used to compute the static three-dimensional (3D) velocity field at various glaciers. A novel MSBAS-3D technique has been developed for computing 3D deformation time series where the SPF constraint is utilized. This technique is used for mapping 3D deformation at the Barnes Ice Cap, Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada, during January–March 2015, and the MSBAS-2D and MSBAS-3D solutions are compared. The MSBAS-3D technique can be used for studying glacier ice flow at other glaciers and other surface deformation processes with large north deformation component, such as landslides.

	abstract = {Advances in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) processing algorithms, such as the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS), and increased data availability from SAR systems, such as Sentinel-1, provide the opportunity to increase the spatial and temporal density of ground deformation measurements. Such measurements, when combined with modelling, have the potential to make a significant cost-effective contribution to the progressive abandonment strategy of recently closed coalfields. Applications of DInSAR over coalfields have observed heave in coal measures rocks and temporal correlations between the rise of mine water and deformation time-series. The cessation of systematic dewatering can have a variety of detrimental impacts and knowledge of the time-scales (i.e. the rate of rebound) and structure of the mine system are crucial to the remediation strategy. Although mine plans and borehole measurements provide vital information in this regard, mine plans are often incomplete or inaccurate, whereas monitoring boreholes are spatially sparse. Consequently, groundwater can flow in unanticipated directions via goaf, mine shafts and roadways, making it difficult to determine where the impacts of rebound are likely to occur. In this study, ground deformation data obtained using ISBAS DInSAR on ENVISAT (2002–2009) and Sentinel-1 (2015–2019) data are used to develop a simple method to model groundwater rebound in abandoned coalfields. A forward analytical model based upon the principle of effective stress and mine water ponds is first implemented to estimate surface heave in response to changes in groundwater levels measured in monitoring boreholes. The forward model is then calibrated and validated using the ground deformation data. The DInSAR data were subsequently inverted to map the change in groundwater levels in greater detail across the coalfield and forecast surface discharges in order to support mitigation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Due to the intrinsic side-looking geometry of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), time series interferometric SAR is only able to monitor displacements in line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which limits the accuracy of displacement measurement in landslide monitoring. This is because the LOS displacement is only a three dimensional projection of real displacement of a certain ground object. Targeting at this problem, a precise digital elevation model (DEM) assisted slope displacement retrieval method is proposed and applied to a case study over the high and steep slope of the Dagushan open pit mine. In the case study, the precise DEM generated by laser scanning is first used to minimize topographic residuals in small baseline subsets analysis. Then, the LOS displacements are converted to slope direction with assistance of the precise DEM. By comparing with ground measurements, relative root mean square errors (RMSE) of the estimated slope displacements reach approximately 12–13% for the ascending orbit, and 5.4–9.2% for the descending orbit in our study area. In order to validate the experimental results, comparison with microseism monitoring results is also conducted. Moreover, both results have found that the largest slope displacements occur on the slope part, with elevations varying from −138 m to −210 m, which corresponds to the landslide area. Moreover, there is a certain correlation with precipitation, as revealed by the displacement time series. The outcome of this article shows that rock mass structure, lithology, and precipitation are main factors affecting the stability of high and steep mining slopes. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The interplay of tectonic and climatic forcing in the development of Alpine deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSD) is still poorly understood. We investigate a giant DSGSD affecting the Piz Dora slope (Val Müstair, Switzerland) by geological, structural and geomorphological analyses, spaceborne SAR interferometry and numerical modelling. The DSGSD affects Permian terrigenous and volcanoclastic successions folded into a kilometre-scale asymmetric anticline during the Alpine orogenesis. The area is characterized by active tectonic uplift and widespread shallow seismicity with dominant dip-slip fault mechanisms, experienced fast deglaciation after the Last Glacial Maximum and periglacial conditions between the Lateglacial and Holocene. The slope is affected by morpho-structural features testifying to the deep-seated gravitational sliding of 1.85 km3 of rock along a basal shear zone over 400 m deep. Analysis of rock glaciers and DInSAR data show that the DSGSD was active in Lateglacial times and is presently deforming at rates ö 15 mm/yr. Integrated kinematic analysis of field and radar data outlines a key control of the inherited fold structure on the DSGSD, with a transition from deep compound sliding to the West, controlled by massive conglomerates (Chazforà Formation), to shallower roto-translational sliding to the East, controlled by volcanoclastic foliated rocks (Ruina Formation). 2DFEM stress-strain numerical models, simulating the post-LGM slope evolution in static, pseudo-static and dynamic conditions allowed evaluating the contribution of long-term seismicity to DSGSD in a paraglacial setting. Dynamic modelling was performed starting from the characterization of a real earthquake, representative of the recent local seismotectonic activity, and scaled to obtain dynamic scenarios with different return periods. Results suggest that deglaciation-related perturbations promoted the inception of the DSGSD but not its complete development, that was likely stimulated by the long-term contribution of recurrent, small earthquakes. Our results suggest that inherited structures, active seismicity and deglaciation cooperate to promote paraglacial rock slope deformation in tectonically active Alpine settings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An automated, fixed-location, time lapse camera system was developed as an alternative to monitoring geological processes with lidar or ground-based interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (GB-InSAR). The camera system was designed to detect fragmental rockfalls and pre-failure deformation at rock slopes. It was implemented at a site along interstate I70 near Idaho Springs, Colorado. The camera system consists of five digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras which collect photographs of the rock slope daily and automatically upload them to a server for processing. Structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry workflows were optimized to be used without ground control. An automated change detection pipeline registers the point clouds with scale adjustment and filters vegetation. The results show that if a fixed pre-calibration of internal camera parameters is used, an accuracy close to that obtained using ground control points can be achieved. Over the study period between March 19, 2018 and June 24, 2019, a level of detection between 0.02 to 0.03 m was consistently achieved, and over 50 rockfalls between 0.003 to 0.1 m3 were detected at the study site.

	abstract = {Ground-Based SAR Interferometry (GB-InSAR) is nowadays a proven technique widely used for slope monitoring in open pit mines and landslide control. Traditional GB-InSAR techniques involve transmitting and receiving antennas moving on a scanner to achieve the desired synthetic aperture. Mechanical movement limits the acquisition speed of the SAR image. There is a need for faster acquisition time as it plays an important role in correcting rapidly varying atmospheric effects. Also, a fast imaging radar can extend the applications to the measurement of vibrations of large structures. Furthermore, the mechanical assembly put constraints on the transportability and weight of the system. To overcome these limitations an electronically switched array would be preferable, which however faces enormous technological and cost difficulties associated to the large number of array elements needed. Imaging Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radars can be used as a significant alternative to usual mechanical SAR and full array systems. This paper describes the ground-based X-band MIMO radar SPARX recently developed by IDS GeoRadar in order to overcome the limits of IDS GeoRadar’s well-established ground based interferometric SAR systems. The SPARX array consists of 16 transmit and 16 receive antennas, organized in independent sub-modules and geometrically arranged in order to synthesize an equally spaced virtual array of 256 elements. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {This study presents a geodetic deformation monitoring approach and its application on two severely affected and uninvestigated study sites in India, namely the Bhurkunda coal mines in Jharkhand, and the Sirobagarh landslide in Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand. For the Bhurkunda site (characterized by underground coal mining related subsidence), a network of 56 GNSS points, densified by Total Station (TS) ground points, was set up during three field visits. GNSS derived deformation estimates reveal that the southern part of the investigated area underwent subsidence (maximum displacement 1.813 m). Furthermore, DEM differences of the three epochs generated using TS points detect a subsidence of 1.358±0.057 m with similar pattern and magnitude of movement as detected by GNSS stations. For the Sirobagarh landslide (witnessing recurring slides due to local geological conditions and rainfall), a GNSS network of six control points in an area of 500×600 m2 was established. Deformation estimates from GNSS show subsidence in the area with a horizontal trend of movement towards the Alaknanda river situated below the landslide (maximum horizontal and vertical displacement values are 0.1306 m and 2.1315 m respectively). Further, for the Sirobagarh landslide, multi-temporal interferometry using Sentinel-1 SAR images detect displacement vectors showing downward movement of the landslide, with displacement rates ranging from 0.008 to −0.115 m yr−1. It is evident that the landslide scarp encountered high magnitude subsidence, whereas the area containing and surrounding the landslide (~30 km2) underwent a moderate rate of subsidence.

Though ground-based, interferometric, synthetic aperture radar (GB-InSAR) has been successfully implemented for near real-time monitoring of natural and man-made slopes, it has seen limited use in Canada outside of the mining industry. This lack of adoption in the rural areas of Canada is due to difficulties associated with providing continuous power to remote sites, other logistical challenges, and concerns with the impact of snow cover on the data collected.

The site is characterized by long periods of deep snow cover, cold temperatures, no connection to the electrical grid, and a location within a steep valley that limits hours of daylight for solar power.

In this paper, the alpha version of the remotIO (Retrieval of Motions and Potential Deformation Threats) system is presented. It is currently able to provide continuous and autonomous updates of MT-InSAR results and post-processing methodology over sites with active deformation hazards to ease the interpretation and facilitate decision-supporting tools for on-time situational awareness. Our post-processing approach implemented in remotIO's web application has proven to be useful in filtering the resultant deformation maps and in pinpointing problematic zones with potential ground deformation threats also over low-coherent areas. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Fengxian County in East China has experienced rapid urban development over the past decades, resulting in environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization, such as pollution, resource depletion, land subsidence, among others. In this study, we analyzed ground subsidence in Fengxian and Peixian counties associated with urbanization and mining activities by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series technology, using 26 Sentinel-1A SAR images taken between July 2015 and March 2017. The results reveal that during the study period serious subsidence occurred in Fengxian town and the area of northern Peixian county. The maximum subsidence rate of the study area reached 75 mm/a, with an average subsidence rate of 15.9 mm/a. The subsidence rate was higher in the newly established districts east of Fengxian town than in the old town district. The most severe ground displacement in Peixian County occurred in the Zhang-shuang-lou mining area, while Peixian town itself was stable. These different spatial distributions of ground subsidence in the two county towns are highly correlated with their differing types of economic activities. We conclude that the relationship between ground subsidence and urbanization in these two county towns provides the basis for scientific decision-making regarding urban development. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

A-DInSAR processing provided the removal of the atmospheric phase artifacts, baseline related errors, DEM height error estimation and finally the ground displacement determination. The results pointed out that with both techniques it was possible to assess the stability conditions of the Germano mining assets, particularly the main structures of the Germano dam and the detection of small settlements in the mining tailings storage, pointing out that these may be an important components for risk management of open pit mining operations, including tailings dams. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {The coastline environment and urban areas of Peru overlooking the Pacific Ocean are among the most affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and its cascading hazards such as floods, landslides and avalanches. In this work, the complete archives of the European Space Agency (ESA)'s European Remote-Sensing (ERS-1/2) missions and European Commission's Copernicus Sentinel-1 constellation were screened to select synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images covering the most severe and recent ENSO-related flooding events that affected Lima, the capital and largest city of Peru, in 1997-1998 and 2017-2018. Based on SAR backscatter color composites and ratio maps retrieved from a series of pre-, cross-and post-event SAR pairs, flooded areas were delineated within the Rimac River watershed. These are mostly concentrated along the riverbanks and plain, where low-lying topography and gentle slopes (≤5°), together with the presence of alluvial deposits, also indicate greater susceptibility to flooding. A total of 409 areas (58.50 km2) revealing change were mapped, including 197 changes (32.10 km2) due to flooding-related backscatter variations (flooded areas, increased water flow in the riverbed, and riverbank collapses and damage), and 212 (26.40 km2) due to other processes (e.g., new urban developments, construction of river embankments, other engineering works, vegetation changes). Urban and landscape changes potentially contributing, either detrimentally or beneficially, to flooding susceptibility were identified and considered in the overall assessment of risk. The extent of built-up areas within the basin was mapped by combining information from the 2011 Global Urban Footprint (GUF) produced by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Open Street Map (OSM) accessed from the Quantum GIS (QGIS) service, and 2011-2019 very high-resolution optical imagery from Google Earth. The resulting flooding risk map highlights the sectors of potential concern along the Rimac River, should flooding events of equal severity as those captured by SAR images occur in the future. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As a typical abrupt geological hazard, rockfalls are widely distributed and occur frequently. It is often difficult to predict the occurrence, and therefore record and monitor the whole failure process of rockfalls. In this study, with the combined use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and ground-based radar interferometry (GB-InSAR) technologies, a typical small collapse in the Hongshiyan post-earthquake rock slope was monitored. An accurate TLS three-dimensional (3D) rock slope model of the study area was established with high-resolution geometry and morphology information, the discontinuity sets and their orientations and distributions were visually identified and analyzed by means of an automatic discontinuity identification algorithm. A perspective view of the whole dynamic failure process of the small collapse was achieved; the displacement behavior during critical sliding stage was revealed by integrating the high-accuracy (millimetric) GB-InSAR monitoring results into the TLS 3D model. It can be used for a complete analysis of the failure behavior and stability assessment of the rock slope during a phase of emergency. The unstable rock block on the slope exhibited a rapid growth of displacement. The dynamic failure process of the rock block underwent three obvious accelerating periods. There was a correspondence between the spatial expansion of the moving area and the process of cracking propagation of rock bridges. The stability of the perilous rock above the tafoni was controlled by the connectivity of rock bridges. Thanks to monitoring, early warning and preventive measure were taken, which avoided a possible undesirable event. This typical case study can provide a reference for the monitoring of an unstable rock slope and the understanding of the evolution of rock block kinematics before collapse. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Land subsidence occurs in Ha Long and Cam Pha cities due to human activities in which the underground coal mining exploitation plays a crucial responsibility. For mapping the spatial distribution of this phenomenon and monitoring its evolution over the time, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) approach was applied to 56 Sentinel-1A images, captured from June 2015 to June 2019. This approach allows monitoring ground displacement by continuously measuring the position of objects that persistently scatter radar beams. This interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique extracts deformation signals and it can be applied to areas where the discontinuous land subsidence is occurring. The mean land subsidence velocity map shows that two principal areas in Ha Long city including Ha Lam, Ha Trung, Ha Khanh, and Ha Tu wards, and Cam Pha city, specifically Mong Duong ward have been subsided in recent years with the maximum velocity of 14.5 mm year−1 and a cumulative displacement ranging from 30 to 50 mm in the Line Of Sight (LOS) direction over 4 years. Field investigation recognized the direct impact of this phenomenon on houses, infrastructures, and natural features located above the underground coal mining utilities.

	abstract = {A good knowledge of the mechanism of slope failure in open-cast mines can be understood by evaluating the intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their interactions in causing slope instability, and by gathering displacement information from periodical monitoring. Surface deformations, caused by mining activities at mine sites, are conventionally measured by using survey instruments such as levels, theodolites, total stations, GPS receivers, and photogrammetric cameras. However, conventional long-term monitoring techniques are insufficient due to unfavorable factors such as topographic structure and flora of the observation, urbanization rate, and time delays in obtaining results. Due to this fact that the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has become prominent in recent years as a method that uses satellite data to enable the detection of surface deformations and movements especially in very large areas. In this study, the mechanism of slope failure accurately detected by way of associating mechanical and physical information of the slopes with time-dependent deformation behavior (time series analysis) by periodically monitoring of displacements at the benches of a lignite open pit that experienced interruptions of production due to slope failures. Mining area has been periodically monitored by InSAR and data consisting of the time-dependent behavior of the deformations were correlated with the mechanical and physical property data that were obtained from back analysis of slope failure using finite elements method (FEM) approximation. In this context, a dynamic method was proposed that can predict the failure risk of the slopes at the site before the critical displacement values are not reached. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

The Dąbrowa Basin is a region where two major factors can affect surface stability: intensive coal exploitation and neotectonic processes. In this study, in order to clarify the origin of surface deformations, the authors propose applying a newly developed algorithm of spatio-temporal PSInSAR data analysis. This analysis revealed that subsidence is a charac-teristic feature of the Dąbrowa Basin. A significant correlation exists between slow, long-term ground deformations and the location of the main tectonic structure of this region. The proposed spatiotemporal analysis of the PSInSAR data additionally showed some degree of correlation between mining activity and the studied deformations.

Here we use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations to determine the source parameters of the sequence and to investigate the relationship with local injection activities. Both Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 SAR images are collected to measure coseismic and preseismic surface deformation. Geodetic inversions with coseismic observations show that the sequence ruptured a previously unmapped southwest-dipping thrust fault above 3 km depth, which intersects with the open-hole sections of wells for solution mining of salt. In the 4 months before the sequence, cumulative line-of-sight displacements near the wells are around 1–2 cm after correcting seasonal-like deformation. Our results indicate that water injection likely enhanced pore pressure within the fault zone and thus contributed to inducing the sequence. ©2020. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

The LMEWS utilizes cutting-edge technologies like satellite- and ground-based InSAR as well as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to ensure flexibility, transferability, and maximum protection against vandalism. © 2021 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Slope deformation in mountainous terrain can be driven by different processes, the nature of which is either gravitational and irreversible or seasonal and reversible, the latter induced by permafrost variations or by hydromechanical or thermomechanical effects. The importance of identifying such deformations is not only related to the hazard they can pose, but also to the understanding of changes that permafrost or local hydrological conditions undergo. Here, we carry out a multi-temporal InSAR analysis over a mountainous area 8000 km2 large, straddling north-western Bhutan and southern Tibet. We propose a methodology to separate locally deforming areas from the effects of long-wavelength signals through the analysis of the spatio-temporal behaviour of 4-years long time series of surface displacements. We present the mapping of hundreds of small-scale features that appear to be actively deforming, as well as several examples of reversible deformation rarely detected at this scale in such a challenging and vast region. The analysis of the multi-annual trend of ground deformation shows a relatively small number of irreversible gravitational movements clearly related to rock slides which attests a low level of recent activity of large rock slope instabilities in the region. In the southernmost, lower elevation parts of the study area, we quantify reversible surface displacements with amplitudes ranging between 5 and 17 mm, and showing maximum displacements towards the satellite in summer months, thus compatible with hydro-mechanical effects related to groundwater table variations. In addition, the ground movement induced by the active layer's response to thawing and freezing over the gentler slopes and high-elevation permafrost regions of Bhutan and southern Tibet is on average around 10 mm, with maxima up to 28 mm. The localised displacements appear to be largely associated to braided stream plains, glacier outwash plains or low angle, fine sediment covered slopes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {With the aim of addressing the problem of accurately monitoring complete deformation fields over mining areas by means of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), this paper proposes a solution to obtain complete deformation fields using the probability integral model to fuse deformation data derived from Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR), sub-band InSAR and offset-tracking. This method is used for small-scale, medium-scale and large-scale deformation monitoring using D-InSAR, sub-band InSAR and offset-tracking, respectively. Finally, the probability integral model is utilized to integrate the three deformation fields, and a complete deformation field with high-accuracy over the study area can be obtained. The method is tested on 13 TerraSAR-X (TSX) images from December 2, 2012 to April 24, 2013 of the working face 52,304 of the Daliuta mining area in Shaanxi province, China. The complete deformation field of the working face during the 113-day mining period is obtained. The results show that during the process of working face advancing, the subsidence basin has been expanding along the direction of excavation. The relationship between the average maximum subsidence rate and the advancing distance of the working face can be described by a quadratic polynomial. It has been also observed that, when the underground mining reaches the full mining condition, the maximum subsidence value does not increase further. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified against the global positioning system field survey data. The root mean square errors in the strike and dip directions are 0.134 m and 0.105 m, respectively. Due to the support provide by the reserved coal pillars, the subsidence value above the reserved coal pillars is smaller. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Underground mining in coal mining areas will induce large-scale, large-gradient surface deformation, threatening the safety of people's lives and property in nearby areas. Due to mining-related subsidence is characterized by fast displacement and high nonlinearity, monitoring this process by using traditional and single interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is very challenging, and it cannot accurately and quantitatively calculate the deformation of the mining area. In this paper, we proposed a new method that combines both multitemporal consecutive D-InSAR and offset tracking technology to construct a complete deformation field of the coal mining area. Taking into account the accuracy of multitemporal consecutive D-InSAR in calculating small deformation areas and the ability of offset tracking to measure large deformation areas, we utilized their respective advantages to extract the surface influence range and applied an adaptive spatial filtering method to integrate their respective results for inversion of the deformation field. 12 ascending high-resolution TerraSAR-X images (2 m) from September 3, 2018, to October 26, 2019, and 39 descending Sentinel-1 TOPS SAR images from August 5, 2018, to November 4, 2019, in the Ordos Coalfield located at Inner Mongolia, China, were utilized to obtain the whole subsidence field of the working faces F6211 and F6207 during the 454-day mining period. The GPS monitoring station located in the direction of the mining surface is used to verify the accuracy of the above method; at the same time, to a certain extent, the difference between the unmanned aerial vehicle's DSM data acquired after coal mining and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM) DEM can qualitatively verify the accuracy of the results. Our results show that the results of TerraSAR are basically consistent with the deformation trend of GPS data, and that of Sentinel-1 have large errors compared with GPS. The maximum central subsidence reaches ∼12 m in the working face F6211 and ∼4 m in the working face F6207. In the working face F6207, the good agreement between GPS and TerraSAR results indicated that the method above using high-resolution SAR data could be reliable for monitoring the large deformation area in the mining field.

	abstract = {Incremental vertical ground movements due to coal mining can increase landslide susceptibility greatly in a short time and have thus triggered a large number of geological disasters, especially in the Karst Region, where a lot of steep slopes are on fractured rocks. Therefore, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) in Karst Region should be updated regularly. This paper presents an effcient methodology to update and refine LSM by using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data directly. First, an original LSM was produced by using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, and the distribution of coal mining was considered a crucial factor to generate the LSM. Then, the Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique was implemented to retrieve displacement time-series. Finally, the landslide displacement map, produced by the PSInSAR analysis, was projected to the direction of the steepest slope and resampled to the same cell in the LSM, to update the original LSM. This methodology is illustrated with the case study of Bijie in the Karst Region of Southwest China, wherein the ascending RADARSAT-2 and descending Sentinel-1 datasets are processed for the period of 2017-2019. The results show that the susceptibility degree increased in 56.41 km2 of the study area, and 80 percent of the increased susceptibility degree was caused by coal mining. The comparison between original and refined LSM in two specific areas revealed that the proposed method can produce more-reliable landslide susceptibility maps in areas of intense mining activities in the Karst Region. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Surface subsidence that results from longwall mining can be large magnitude and can affect significant areas. Conventional methods for subsidence monitoring include leveling, global positioning system (GPS), and photogrammetric surveys. Remote sensing techniques including, aerial LiDAR, terrestrial laser scanning, and satellite-based Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), are also used to measure deformation associated with subsidence. DInSAR data are different than data from conventional subsidence surveys. Images capture data over large areas (hundreds of kilometers), and each pixel (data point) in an image quantifies the average displacement over an area of square meters. DInSAR data can have fairly high time resolution; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. DInSAR data can be useful to monitor subsidence sequentially over short periods. Regularly monitoring subsidence may help define if caving is progressing normally and can establish relationships between surface deformation and longwall face advance, which has potential to help quantify possible risks to mine stability. In this study, subsidence at a longwall trona mine is monitored over short periods, typically 12 days, as the longwall face is advanced through a panel. C-band interferometric wide swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. The onset of subsidence occurs close in time to the beginning of the longwall face advance, and overall, the development of subsidence closely follows the longwall face advance. © 2020},

	abstract = {Many features and phenomena, such as slope morphology, climate, hydrogeological and hydrological conditions, and material strength, contribute to slope instability. One of the most important preconditioning factors, particularly in rock slopes, is structural control. Structural control includes any tectonic processes or features that may influence landslide initiation, movement, or termination, including in situ stress conditions, discontinuities, faults, folds, and foliation. Structures affect not only the failure geometry, such as headscarp shape, but also deposit volume, morphology, block size, damage, and emplacement behaviour. Structural features and processes thus influence all aspects of landslide behaviour, from the development of unstable conditions to deposition. Interestingly, mass movement studies can also highlight structures, and contribute to detailed mapping of previously unrecognised faults, folds, and other features. Methods such as regional lineament mapping, traditional fieldwork, photography and photogrammetry, LiDAR surveys, InSAR interpretation, and numerical modelling are used to analyse structural features and processes related to slope instability.

	abstract = {Slope failures are life-Threatening geohazards well-known in the mining industry, where a single accident can endanger workers and cause million dollars'-worth of activity downtime. Therefore, a detailed ground deformation map of an open-pit mine represents a vital planning tool and high-frequency monitoring is pivotal, since false or anticipated alarms may represent a higher impact than missed alarms. This article presents an application of interferometric satellite data from Sentinel-1. The scope of the study is showing the potential of the new generation of satellites for the detection of the boundary, typology, and kinematics of the on-going slope instabilities in open-pit mines. Most notably, this experience discloses how the short revisiting time (six days) permits the implementation of time of failure forecasting methods, which so far were a prerogative of ground-based monitoring systems. Only recently, a few experiences have shown the possibility of (a posteriori) predicting slope failures using displacement time series measured from satellite; the case study here described represents one of such first examples. Moreover, 11 other areas of instability have been detected and classified in terms of subsidence (sediment compaction) or slope failures, based on considerations concerning the acquisition geometry used to detect the movements. The movement vectors along the ascending and descending lines of sight have been combined to compute horizontal and vertical vectors, which have been employed to infer the geometry of the sliding surface of some selected slope instabilities. Despite the advancements of the technique, clear limitations still exist and are discussed in this article. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In order to establish sustainable heat loading (heat removal and storage) in abandoned flooded mine workings it is important to understand the geomechanical impact of the cyclical heat loading caused by fluid injection and extraction. This is particularly important where significantly more thermal loading is planned than naturally occurs. A simple calculation shows that the sustainable geothermal heat flux from abandoned coal mines can provide less than a tenth of Scotland’s annual domestic heating demand. Any heat removal greater than the natural heat flux will lead to heat mining unless heat storage options are also considered. As a first step, a steady-state, fully saturated, 2D coupled hydromechanical model of a generalized section of pillar-and-stall workings has been created. Mine water rebound was modelled by increasing the hydrostatic pressure sequentially, in line with monitored mine water-level data from Midlothian, Scotland. The modelled uplift to water-level rise ratio of 1.4 mm m−1 is of the same order of magnitude (1 mm m−1) as that observed through interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data in the coalfield due to mine water rebound. The modelled magnitude of shear stress at the pillar corners, as a result of horizontal and vertical displacement, is shown to increase linearly with water level. Mine heat systems are expected to cause smaller changes in pressure than those modelled but the results provide initial implications on the potential geomechanical impacts of mine water heat schemes which abstract or inject water and heat into pillar-and-stall coal mine workings. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Nowadays the use of remote monitoring sensors is a standard practice in landslide characterization and monitoring. In the last decades, technologies such as LiDAR, terrestrial and satellite SAR interferometry (InSAR) and photogrammetry demonstrated a great potential for rock slope assessment while limited studies and applications are still available for ArcSAR Interferometry, Gigapixel imaging and Acoustic sensing. Taking advantage of the facilities located at the Poggio Baldi Landslide Natural Laboratory, an intensive monitoring campaign was carried out on May 2019 using simultaneously the HYDRA‐G ArcSAR for radar monitoring, the Gigapan robotic system equipped with a DSLR camera for photo‐monitoring purposes and the DUO Smart Noise Monitor for acoustic measurements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of each monitoring sensor and to investigate the ongoing gravitational processes at the Poggio Baldi landslide. Analysis of multi‐temporal Gigapixel‐images revealed the occurrence of 84 failures of various sizes between 14–17 May 2019. This allowed us to understand the short‐term evolution of the rock cliff that is characterized by several impulsive rockfall events and continuous debris production. Radar displacement maps revealed a constant movement of the debris talus at the toe of the main rock scarp, while acoustic records proved the capability of this technique to identify rockfall events as well as their spectral content in a narrow range of frequencies between 200 Hz to 1000 Hz. This work demonstrates the great potential of the combined use of a variety of remote sensors to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution data in the field of landslide characterization and monitoring. © 2021 by the authors.

Such an event makes us realize the significance of loess slope instability detection. Therefore, it is essential to identify the potential active landslides, monitor their displacements, and sort out dominant controlling factors. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (InSAR) has been recognized as an effective tool for geological hazard mapping with wide coverage and high precision. In this study, the time series InSAR analysis method was applied to map the unstable areas in Xiangning County, as well as surrounding areas from C-band Sentinel-1 datasets acquired from March 2017 to 2019. A total number of 597 unstable sites covering 41.7 km2 were identified, among which approximately 70% are located in the mountainous areas which are prone to landslides. In particular, the freezing and thawing cycles might be the primary triggering factor for the failure of the Xiangning landslide. Furthermore, the nonlinear displacements of the active loess slopes within this region were found to be correlated significantly with precipitation. Therefore, a climate-driven displacement model was employed to explore the quantitative relationship between rainfall and nonlinear displacements. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {<p>The Heze section of Rizhao-Lankao high-speed railway (RLHR-HZ) has been under construction since 2018 and will be in operation by the end of 2021. However, there is a concern that land subsidence in the Heze region may affect the regular operation of RLHR-HZ. In this study, we investigate the contemporary ground deformation in the region between 2015 and 2019 by using more than 350 C-band interferograms constructed from two tracks of Sentinel-1 data over the region. The small baseline subset (SBAS) technique is adopted to compile the time-series displacement. We find that the RLHR-HZ runs through two main subsidence areas: one is located east of the Heze region with rates ranging from <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-4</span> to <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span> <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">cm yr-1</span>, and another one is located in the coalfield with rates ranging from <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-8</span> to <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-2</span> <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">cm yr-1</span>. A total length of 35 <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">km</span> of RLHR-HZ is affected by the two subsidence basins. Considering the previous investigation and the monthly precipitation, we infer that the subsidence bowl east of the Heze region is due to massive extraction of deep groundwater. Close inspections of the relative locations between the second subsidence area and the underground mining reveals that the subsidence there is probably caused by the groundwater outflow and fault instability due to mining, rather than being directly caused by mining. The InSAR-derived ground subsidence implies that it is necessary to continue monitoring the ground deformation along RLHR-HZ.</p>. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) has been used to monitor surface deformations in open pit mines and tailings dams. In this paper, ground deformations have been detected on the area of tailings Dam-I at the Córrego do Feijão Mine (Brumadinho, Brazil) before its catastrophic failure occurred on 25 January 2019. Two techniques optimized for different scattering models, SBAS (Small BAseline Subset) and PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry), were used to perform the analysis based on 26 Sentinel-1B images in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which were acquired on descending orbits from 03 March 2018 to 22 January 2019. A WorldDEM Digital Surface Model (DSM) product was used to remove the topographic phase component. The results provided by both techniques showed a synoptic and informative view of the deformation process affecting the study area, with the detection of persistent trends of deformation on the crest, middle, and bottom sectors of the dam face until its collapse, as well as the settlements on the tailings. It is worth noting the detection of an acceleration in the displacement time-series for a short period near the failure. The maximum accumulated displacements detected along the downstream slope face were −39 mm (SBAS) and −48 mm (PSI). It is reasonable to consider that Sentinel-1 would provide decision makers with complementary motion information to the in situ monitoring system for risk assessment and for a better understanding of the ongoing instability phenomena affecting the tailings dam. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Vertical deformation estimation can be a significant tool in preventing geological hazards and managing environment impacts of underground mining. Common ground surface vertical deformation calculations are challenged by difficult data collection and dependence on prior knowledge. SVD (singular value decomposition) method was applied to estimate ground surface vertical deformation from single pair SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data in a mining region. During the study, LOS (line of sight) and azimuth displacement was obtained using two pass D-InSAR (differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar) and MAI (multi-aperture radar interferometry) technology, respectively. Two adjustment equations were composed using the imaging geometry of D-InSAR and MAI. The singular value decomposition theorem was used to acquire M-P (Moore-Penrose) generalized inverse of the rank deficiency coefficient matrix. From this, the optimal approximation solution of unknown parameters was calculated using weighted least squares. A working panel in the Datong mining area, Shanxi province, China, was selected to verify the SVD approach using the two ascending Sentinel-1A data. The accuracy of vertical deformation estimated by SVD approach is reliable. The RMSE (root mean square error) of vertical deformation is 2.64 mm (along upright profile) and 4.95 mm (along horizontal profile). These results suggest that the SVD approach will complement widely used vertical ground surface deformation calculations. Further study is needed to validate the method from other deformation scenarios from landslides, groundwater loss, earthquakes, underground mining, and glacier movement. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Caused by the underground longwall mining activities, ground deformation, which includes sudden large-level deformation, slow small-level deformation and the middle-level deformation between them, can lead to serious construction damage and ecological environment degradation. In this paper, we propose a new fusion model that is able to completely retrieve multi-level deformation with measured radar line-of-sight (LOS) deformation from offset-tracking (OT) and differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technique (referred to as OTD-InSAR). The results from OTD-InSAR show that small-level deformation on the edge of subsidence basin and large-level deformation in the central portion of subsidence basin are measured with high accuracy. The multi-level deformation fusion model considers the geographic information and SAR data information simultaneously to fuse large-level and small-level deformation and use inverse distance weighting method (IDW) to estimate the middle-level deformation. Due to the insufficient measured data in the actual situation, we present the prediction model to forecast the long period deformation evolution of full workface based on the exponent Knothe model and the fusion results. The 52,303 workface in Daliuta coal mining area in China was selected to verify the effectiveness of the fusion model and prediction model. The comparison between the fusion results and the in-situ measured data shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 0.23 m. Results of deformation prediction model are found to be very close to fusion results and the RMSE is less than 0.027 m. This research work has brought about a comprehensive analysis of the deformation evolution of the full workface with high precision from the beginning to the end of coal mining for about 18 months. As a result, the monitoring results can support the requirements of mining deformation monitoring in the management of surface disaster. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Land surface deformation in metropolitan areas, which can cause varying degrees of hazard to both human lives and to properties, has been documented for decades in cities worldwide. Xuzhou, is one of the most important energy and industrial bases in eastern China, and has experienced significant land subsidence due to both excessive extraction of karst underground water and exploitation of mineral resources in recent decades. Furthermore, Xuzhou has recently undergone rapid urbanization in terms of urban expansion and underground construction, which could induce additional pressure on the urban land surface. However, most previous research on land surface deformation in the Xuzhou urban areas has been conducted based on traditional ground-based deformation monitoring techniques with sparse measurements. Little is known about the regional spatiotemporal behavior of land surface displacement in Xuzhou. In this study, a detailed interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis was performed to characterize the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of land surface deformation in central areas of Xuzhou during 2015-2018. A method based on principal component analysis was adopted to correct artifacts in the InSAR signal. Results showed the correction strategy markedly reduced the discrepancy between global navigation satellite systems and InSAR measurements. Noticeable land subsidence (-5 to -41 mm/yr) was revealed widely within the Xuzhou urban areas, particularly along subway lines under construction, newly developed districts, and in old coal goafs. Remarkable consistent land uplift (up to +25 mm/yr) was found to have significantly affected two long narrow areas within the old goafs since 2015. The possible principal influencing factors contributing to the land surface displacements such as subway tunneling, building construction, mining, underground water levels and geological conditions are then discussed. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper proposed a method based on the SBAS-InSAR and gray wolf optimization algorithm aiming at the time-consuming and laborious defects of the traditional method used to obtain the expected parameters of the probability integral method and the shortcomings of the InSAR technology in the field of large gradient deformation detection in the mining area. The fitness function of the algorithm was established based on the geometric relationship between the radar side imaging and the three-dimensional model of the probability integral method. The stable sinking point of the settlement boundary obtained by SBAS-InSAR was used as the input value for the calculation of the predicted parameters of the probability integral method. Firstly, the simulation experiment was employed for the simulation of the direction of the InSAR line of sight combined with the geological mining conditions of the assumed working face, thereby obtaining the probability integral prediction parameters of the working face. Consequently, the maximum relative error of q, b, tanβ, and θ0 does not exceed 8%, and that of S1, S2, S3, and S4 does not exceed 35.5% (low parameter sensitivity). The error of the LOS-direction deformation fitting is 0.076 m, which meets the tolerance requirements, and the result is trustworthy. At last, the parameter finding method is applied to the engineering example, that is, the 112201 working face of Xiaobaodang Coal Mine in the northern Shaanxi mining area. The settlement value of the stable boundary point is obtained based on the SBAS-InSAR results, which is substituted into the fitness function. And the GWO optimization algorithm is used for optimization and parameter finding; the probability integral expected parameters of the working face are calculated as q=0.63, b=0.37, tanβ=2.76, θ0=83.94, S1=-36.34 m, S2=26.69 m, S3=-45.64 m, and S4=39.62 m. Substitute the obtained parameters into the probability integral model for the prediction of the vertical and horizontal displacements of the working face, and verify its accuracy with the GPS measured data. The results showed that the maximum absolute error of vertical displacement reached 116 mm, the median error was 63 mm, and the maximum absolute error of north-south horizontal movement reached 56 mm; meanwhile, the median error was 23 mm, the maximum absolute error of east-west horizontal movement reached 61 mm, and the median error was 29 mm; all the above parameters are within the tolerance range, indicating that the method for the calculation of probability integral parameters proposed in this paper is applicable in actual engineering. © 2021 Tieming Liu et al.},

	abstract = {Landslide mapping is one of the most important steps which take place in the early stages of a landslide survey, contributing to the immediate assessment of slide’s effects. Nowadays in this direction, different remote sensing techniques have been developed providing effective results. This work deals with the exploitation of optical data as well as radar data aiming at the mapping of a landslide area located in Western Macedonia, Greece. The landslide occurred in June 2017 at the lignite open pit mine of Aminteo. In that context Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data were acquired in order to be processed appropriately for the imprinting of disturbed areas. In particular, Sentinel-1 images before and after the landslide were processed interferometrically, yielding to the estimation of vertical displacements. Concerning optical data, the images were submitted to diverse digital processing techniques the results were visualized in GIS environment. The derived results were compared and evaluated for their accuracy and identification. It is worth mentioning that the specific methodology may also be applied to more extensive landslides or landslides triggered by different factors. Additionally, it could be assumed that the methodology can be applied to mass movements as a result of earthquakes. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Ground falls represent a significant hazard at underground mines in the stone, sand, and gravel (SSG) sector in the USA. Researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are currently conducting detailed investigations into the complex loading conditions at underground stone mines operating in challenging conditions. This paper presents the application of numerical modeling to analyze pillar and roof stability at a dipping underground limestone mine. A validated numerical model was used to explore the potential behavior of the pillars and roof as loading conditions change. The validated model was used to compare changes in mining sequence, overburden depth, and the in situ stress field. This will allow mine operators and engineers to have a better idea of the conditions that could be encountered as mining progresses. Results from the numerical modeling indicate that roof displacement more than doubles as the vertical stress increases from 10 MPa (1450 psi) to 19 MPa (2750 psi) when the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses were 41 MPa (5950 psi) and 22 MPa (3190 psi), respectively. Consequently, as the pillar load increases, the safety factor of the pillars is projected to decrease by about 25%. The impact of the practical application of numerical models can result in a reduction of ground-fall accidents and injuries as well as generally safer working conditions. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

	abstract = {The south slope of the Fushun west open-pit mine in China is geologically complex and is a high-steep rock slope. In recent years, a larger deformation has appeared in the south slope, with the gradual formation of a potential landsliding block that is estimated to be over 300 m3. The east and south boundaries of the block have been identified using different monitoring techniques. However the west boundary has not yet been clearly delineated, a situation which undermines safety assessments and the slope management of the mine. The focus of this was on how the microseismic technology, DInSAR technique and the numerical method are used to determine the shape and formation of the west boundary of the potential sliding block. We found that the upper part of west boundary as determined by numerical simulation is concordant with that determined by microseismic monitoring. The surface deformation area coincides with the DInSAR monitoring results and damage area based on in situ observations. Numerical simulation provides supplementary information on the distribution of stress and the formation process of the west boundary that cannot be observed directly on-site. The microseismic monitoring system was able to capture the progressive rupture of the west boundary during the deformation of the block. The cooperative monitoring strategy together with the numerical simulation can delineate the sliding surface and provide a method for a comprehensive assessment of the slope stability of other similar open-pit mines. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Central Asian mountain regions are prone to multiple types of natural hazards, often causing damage due to the impact of mass movements. In spring 2017, Kyrgyzstan suffered significant losses from a massive landslide activation event, during which also two of the largest deep-seated mass movements of the former mining area of Mailuu-Suu—the Koytash and Tektonik landslides—were reactivated. This study consists of the use of optical and radar satellite data to highlight deformation zones and identify displacements prior to the collapse of Koytash and to the more superficial deformation on Tektonik. Especially for the first one, the comparison of Digital Elevation Models of 2011 and 2017 (respectively, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery-based) highlights areas of depletion and accumulation, in the scarp and near the toe, respectively. The Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry analysis identified slow displacements during the months preceding the reactivation in April 2017, indicating the long-term sliding activity of Koytash and Tektonik. This was confirmed by the computation of deformation time series, showing a positive velocity anomaly on the upper part of both landslides. Furthermore, the analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index revealed land cover changes associated with the sliding process between June 2016 and October 2017. In addition, in situ data from a local meteorological station highlighted the important contribution of precipitation as a trigger of the collapse. The multidirectional approach used in this study demonstrated the efficiency of applying multiple remote sensing techniques, combined with a meteorological analysis, to identify triggering factors and monitor the activity of landslides. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Ground subsidences, either caused by natural phenomena or human activities, can threaten the safety of nearby infrastructures and residents. Among the different causes, mining operations can trigger strong subsidence phenomena with a fast nonlinear temporal behaviour. Therefore, a reliable and precise deformation monitoring is of great significance for safe mining and protection of facilities located above or near the mined-out area. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a technique that uses stacks Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to remotely monitor the ground deformation of large areas with a high degree of precision at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, PSI presents limitations when monitoring large gradient deformations when there is phase ambiguity among adjacent Persistent Scatterer (PS) points. In this paper, an improvement of PSI processing, named as External Model-based Deformation Decomposition PSI (EMDD-PSI), is proposed to address this limitation by taking advantage of an external model. The proposed method first uses interferograms generated from SAR Single Look Complex (SLC) images to optimize the parameter adjustments of the external model. Then, the modelled spatial distribution of subsidence is utilized to reduce the fringes of the interferograms generated from the SAR images and to ease the PSI processing. Finally, the ground deformation is retrieved by jointly adding the external model and PSI results. In this paper, fourteen Radarsat-2 SAR images over Fengfeng mining area (China) are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method. The results are evaluated by comparing them with leveling data of the area covering the same temporal period. Results have shown that, after the optimization, the model is able to mimic the real deformation and the fringes of the interferograms can be effectively reduced. As a consequence, the large gradient deformation then can be better retrieved with the preservation of the nonlinear subsidence term. The ground truth shows that, comparing with the classical PSI and PSI with unadjusted parameters, the proposed scheme reduces the error by 35.2% and 20.4%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The article presents the results of applying a Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method to the monitoring of the influence of underground mining exploitation on terrain surface. Calculations were performed on the basis of two large SAR data sets. Calculations of time series additionally employed the Tymofyeyeva and Fialko empirical method for estimating atmospheric delay. A series of test calculations allowed verifying the potential of the method. The SBAS calculations were based on theoretical data prepared with the use of the Mogi model. This approach allowed simulating both underground mining exploitation and induced tremors. The results indicate that the model is useful in detecting sudden ground surface deformations. In such a situation, the image of a tremor can be observed in the atmospheric component. The actual data used in the analysis covered a region of underground copper ore extraction in southwest Poland. The calculations were based on SAR data obtained from the Sentinel 1A/B satellites, for the period between the end of 2014 and May 2018, from paths 22 and 73. In both cases, the total number of images exceeded 120. They served to calculate over 420 interferograms for each set. The results of ground surface displacements allowed precise identification of areas affected by underground mining activity. Over the acquisition period of six days, sufficient amount of SAR data was obtained to precisely monitor surface changes in the analyzed area. The employed empirical atmospheric delay reduction method was demonstrated to enable the detection of sudden ground surface changes due to mining tremors. This feature makes the method useful in detecting induced seismic events in areas characterized by intensive mining activity. It allows determining tremor locations in cases when acquisition dates are greater than the optimal value of 6-12 days (in the case of Sentinel 1A/B). © 2019 by the authors.},

The work is aimed to improve the knowledge of the petrographic and petrophysical characteristics of the siliciclastic and carbonate geological formations that make up the potential caprock-reservoir system. Core samples from a number of wells drilled in the study area for mining purposes were analyzed especially for texture and physical properties (longitudinal velocity, density, porosity, and permeability). The preliminary integrated petrographic and petrophysical characterizations indicate that the Upper Paleocene to Early Eocene potential carbonate reservoir is heterogeneous but presents suitable reservoir zones for CO2. A preliminary analysis of the potential caprock siliciclastic lithologies of the Middle Eocene to Lower Oligocene suggests that they appear suitable for CO2 confinement. Finally, to account for the stability of the investigated area, an accurate geodynamical study of south-western Sardinia was carried out using global navigation satellite system and advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar methodologies in order to estimate vertical and horizontal crustal displacements. The study area results stable, since it is characterized by surface crustal horizontal and vertical velocities smaller than 1 mm/year and few mm/year, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Study of the mechanical response of rock slopes to moderate earthquakes is important for understanding the local rheology of landslide and earthquake interactions and for mitigating the risks associated with subsurface geological processes in tectonically active mountainous belts. To complement existing point measurements from surface observations (e.g., global positioning system and interferometric synthetic-aperture radar measurements), measuring the ambient noise-based velocity change ((Formula presented.)) allows for remote observations of mechanical state changes of the slope, at depth and continuously in time. We herein investigate the seismic responses of the Pubugou rock slope, a typical steep rock slope in south-west China, to the 2019 Mw 5.7 Changning earthquake. We apply ambient noise interferometry to the slope and measure the coda wave velocity changes at frequencies from 2 to 20 Hz with a 1-h temporal resolution, 2 days before and 14 days after the earthquake. We observe a significant co-seismic wave velocity decrease caused by the Changning earthquake of up to 0.9% followed by a gradual logarithmic recovery process over 2 weeks.

However, DInSAR methods require expert knowledge and specialized software, and they are time-consuming. Here, we demonstrate that a land subsidence signal can be identified in the differences in the freely available global digital elevation models (e.g., SRTM and TanDEM-X) using a simple statistical method. This finding opens up a venue to develop a computer application to identify land subsidence or uplift of a few decimeters per at least a decade order.

	abstract = {Satellite interferometric data are widely exploited for ground motion monitoring thanks to their wide area coverage, cost efficiency and non-invasiveness. The launch of the Sentinel-1 constellation opened new horizons for interferometric applications, allowing the scientists to rethink the way in which these data are delivered, passing from a static view of the territory to a continuous streaming of ground motion measurements from space. Tuscany Region is the first worldwide example of a regional scale monitoring system based on satellite interferometric data. The processing chain here exploited combines a multi-interferometric approach with a time-series data mining algorithm aimed at recognizing benchmarks with significant trend variations. The system is capable of detecting the temporal changes of a wide variety of phenomena such as slow-moving landslides and subsidence, producing a high amount of data to be interpreted in a short time. Bulletins and reports are derived to the hydrogeological risk management actors at regional scale. The final output of the project is a list of potentially hazardous and accelerating phenomena that are verified on site by field campaign by completing a sheet survey in order to qualitatively estimate the risk and to suggest short-term actions to be taken by local entities. Two case studies, one related to landslides and one to subsidence, are proposed to highlight the potential of the monitoring system to early detect anomalous ground changes. Both examples represent a successful implementation of satellite interferometric data as monitoring and risk management tools, raising the awareness of local and regional authorities to geohazards. © 2019 by the authors},

Ground subsidence as a result of mining is one of the main causes of environmental damage in Peixian. Using temporarily coherent points interferometry synthetic aperture radar (TCPInSAR), which is characterized by phase unwrapping and temporary coherent points (TCPs), 43 Sentinel-1A images acquired from 4 October 2016 to 21 April 2018 were processed to generate time-series ground deformations of the ZSL (Zhang-shuang-lou), the XZ (Xu-zhuang) and the KZ (Kong-zhuang) mines in the southern region of Peixian. The results showed that the maximum accumulated values for subsidence and velocity in the ZSL mine were − 418.3 mm and − 188.8 mm/year, respectively; the maximum accumulated values of subsidence in the XZ mine and the KZ mine reached − 213.2 mm and − 191.5 mm, respectively. The monitoring results showed that damage to buildings was consistent with underground mining activities. Therefore, on this basis, the time-series subsidence of large mining areas may be monitored using TCPInSAR. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Ground subsidence and surface cracks caused by coal mining are typical man-made geological hazards that can severely damage the ecological environment and buildings. In China, within the theme of sustained and stable development, accurate assessment of mining-related building damage is paramount in order to address the contradiction between coal mining enterprises and building owners. Previous research in China focused mainly on the mining areas of plains, and only a few studies have considered building damage caused by intensive mining in mountainous areas. First, based on field investigation, this study located ground surface cracks and assessed the damage to buildings in the village of Nanyetou in Shanxi Province (China) attributable to the exploitation of the 15110 working face of the Baiyangling coal mine. Second, based on the mining subsidence law and boundary angle, the surface influenced boundary caused by underground mining was determined. However, as the existing subsidence theory cannot adequately explain the phenomenon of building damage, the damage was investigated from the perspective of slope stability analysis, and the slope safety factor before and after working face mining were calculated using the Janbu method. The analytical results showed that slope instability due to a decrease of the safety factor because of the coal mining activity was the principal reason for damage to the village buildings, a finding that was confirmed by field survey and InSAR monitoring displacement. The results of this study could provide guidance and reference for the assessment of building damage caused by underground mining in mountain areas. © 2019 Diao et al.

	abstract = {Monitoring ground displacement produced by underground mining is essential to ensure the safety of infrastructure over mining areas. Differential synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) can only obtain the 1-D [i.e., along the line-of-sight (LOS) direction] displacement component. In this study, we present an improved algorithm for retrieving and predicting 3-D displacement fields induced by underground mining based on the LOS displacement derived from DInSAR and the probability integral method (PIM). Whole parameters included in the standard PIM model are involved in the improved algorithm. In addition, the interaction between multiple working panels is considered and incorporated into the model. Next, a stochastic optimization technique hybridizing the cultural algorithm and random particle swarm optimization has been designed to retrieve model parameters, which can be used to retrieve and predict the 3-D displacement field. Simulated experiments show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 10, 12, and 17 mm in the vertical, east-west, and north-south directions, respectively, by comparing the simulated and retrieved 3-D displacement. Furthermore, the capability of the proposed method is investigated and validated in the Xuehu mining area of China using three ALOS PALSAR acquisitions. Our results agree well with leveling measurements in the vertical direction with an RMSE of 38 mm. Although the retrieved horizontal displacement cannot be validated due to a lack of field surveys, these displacement fields coincide spatially with the evolution of mining excavation. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Displacement monitoring in open-pit mines is one of the important tasks for safe management of mining processes. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), mounted on an artificial satellite, has the potential to be a cost-effective method for monitoring surface displacements over extensive areas, such as open-pit mines. DInSAR requires the ground surface elevation data in the process of its analysis as a digital elevation model (DEM). However, since the topography of the ground surface in open-pit mines changes largely due to excavations, measurement errors can occur due to insufficient information on the elevation of mining areas. In this paper, effect of different elevation models on the accuracy of the displacement monitoring results by DInSAR is investigated at a limestone quarry. In addition, validity of the DInSAR results using an appropriate DEM is examined by comparing them with the results obtained by global positioning system (GPS) monitoring conducted for three years at the same limestone quarry. It is found that the uncertainty of DEMs induces large errors in the displacement monitoring results if the baseline length of the satellites between the master and the slave data is longer than a few hundred meters. Comparing the monitoring results of DInSAR and GPS, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the discrepancy between the two sets of results is less than 10 mm if an appropriate DEM, considering the excavation processes, is used. It is proven that DInSAR can be applied for monitoring the displacements of mine slopes with centimeter-level accuracy. © 2020 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

	abstract = {Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), a satellite-based remote sensing technique, has application for monitoring subsidence with high resolution over short periods. DInSAR uses radar images to measure centimeter-level surface displacements. In the images, ground resolution can be relatively high, with each data point (pixel) representing the average displacement over an area of several square meters. The image data are acquired regularly which allows subsidence to be monitored sequentially over short periods; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. Monitoring subsidence over short periods with high spatial resolution has potential to provide insight into the dynamics of subsidence and into relationships between mine advance and subsidence. In this study, for three longwall mines in the western United States, initial subsidence occurring at the start of longwall advance is quantified over short periods (12–72 days). C-band interferometric wide swath Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. Overall, the data show initial development of subsidence, expansion of the subsidence trough, and the advance of subsidence in the direction of mining. © 2020},

On the basic of a finite difference, method for the strain-softening model is proposed to consider the variation of ψ and η∗ in analyzing the strain-softening behavior of rock masses. Combining the equilibrium equation and strength criterion, the stress conditions for each annulus are calculated analytically. The displacement for each step is obtained analytically by solving the differential equation through invoking flow rule and Hooke's law. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified through the comparison between the results and the previous studies. The effect of intermediate principal stress of GZZ strength criterion is considered; the rationality of the proposed method is verified by two aspects. First, by comparing with the two-dimensional narrow and generalized H-B strength criterion, the advantage of GZZ strength criterion that considers the effect intermediate main stress is highlighted. On the other hand, compared with the three-dimensional linear D-P criterion, the advantage of GZZ strength criterion in the theoretical research of deep underground roadway in coal mine is highlighted. The results show that the strain-softening of the surrounding rock in the plastic zone of the roadway can reduce the pressure of the surrounding rock, but it will greatly increase its deformation. In the high field stress areas, the strain-softening of surrounding rock is the key reason for the destruction of the roadway. It is suggested that in the design and calculation of the support system of the roadway, the strain-softening characteristics of the surrounding rock should be considered, which is very important to avoid large deformation and damage of roadway.  © 2021 Rui Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Surface subsidence is a dominant component of the displacement vector triggered by underground mining. Over the last few decades, Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has been used to efficiently monitor this phenomenon with great spatial and temporal coverage. More advanced multi-temporal DInSAR (MTInSAR) algorithms have been proposed to overcome some of the limitations of conventional DInSAR. However, advanced MTInSAR approaches are also not perfect in terms of measuring mining subsidence (e.g., temporal decorrelation, ambiguity, nonlinearity). For this reason, we propose a fusion of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSInSAR) and DInSAR results. By combining these complementary techniques, the atmospheric errors in PSInSAR data are reduced and larger deformation rates could have been detected more accurately (thanks to DInSAR) than by an approach solely based on PS-InSAR. This allows to measure areas with fast-moving subsidence (1 m/year) due to ongoing underground coal exploitation. Data from ascending and descending orbits of Sentinel-1A\B were used to obtain the vertical deformation component. The resulting integrated vertical deformation map was compared with the results from levelling benchmarks. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculated based on this comparison was 22 mm. Moreover, the maximal vertical cumulative subsidence detected in the study area was 1.05 m/year. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Geological disasters, including ground deformation, fractures and collapse, are serious problems in coal mining regions, which have threatened the sustainable development for local industry. The Ordos Basin is most known for its abundant coal resources. Over-mining the underground coal resources had induced land deformation. Detecting the evolution of the land deformation features and identifying the potential risk are important for decision-makers to prevent geological disasters. We analyzed land subsidence induced by coal mining in a 200 km2 area in the Ordos Basin for the time period 2006-2015. ALOS-1 PALSAR images from December 2006 to January 2011 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images from December 2014 to July 2015, optical remotely sensed images and coal mining information were collected. The small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) method and differential synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) method, GIS and statistical analysis were adopted. Results show that the maximum subsidence rate and cumulative subsidence along the line of sight (LOS) were −56 mm/y and −235 mm, respectively, from December 2006 to January 2011. The maximum cumulative subsidence was −226 mm from December 2014 to July 2015. The new boundary of the mining goafs from 2014 to 2015 and the most dangerous risk region were mapped. Moreover, the effect of large-scale mining coal, with the production volume exceeds 1.2 million tons per year, with the operation time more than 20 years on land subsidence was found greater than small and medium-scale coal mines and reached -59 mm/year. The recently established small-sized and medium-sized coal mines show high land subsidence. This study will contribute to better understand the land subsidence process in mining region and provide scientific support for government to prevent land subsidence. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Spaceborne radar interferometry is a powerful tool to characterize landslides at local and regional scales. However, its application to very slow rock slope deformations in alpine environments (displacement rates < 5 cm/year) remains challenging, mainly due to low signal to noise ratio, atmospheric disturbances, snow cover effects, and complexities resulting from heterogeneous displacement in space and time. Here we combine SqueeSARTM data, targeted multi-temporal baseline DInSAR, GPS data, and detailed field morpho-structural mapping, to unravel the kinematics, internal segmentation, and style of activity of the Mt. Mater deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) in Valle Spluga (Italy). We retrieve slope kinematics by performing 2D decomposition (2D InSAR) of SqueeSARTM products derived from Sentinel-1 data acquired in ascending and descending orbits. To achieve a spatially-distributed characterization of DSGSD displacement patterns and activity, we process Sentinel-1 A/B images (2016-2019) with increasing temporal baselines (ranging from 24-days to 1-year) and generate several multi-temporal interferograms. Unwrapped displacement maps are validated using ground-based GPS data. Interferograms derived with different temporal baselines reveal a strong kinematic and morpho-structural heterogeneity and outline nested rockslides and active sectors, that arise from the background displacement signal of the main DSGSD. Seasonal interferograms, supported by GPS displacement measurements, reveal non-linear displacement trends suggesting a complex response of different slope sectors to rainfall and snowmelt. Our analyses clearly outline a composite slope instability with different nested sectors possibly undergoing different evolutionary trends towards failure. The results herein outline the potential of a targeted use of DInSAR for the detailed investigation of very slow rock slope deformations in different geological and geomorphological settings. © 2020 by the author.},

This paper presents a Range Split Spectrum Interferometry assisted Phase Unwrapping (R-SSIaPU) method for the first time. The R-SSIaPU method takes advantage of (i) the capability of Range Split Spectrum Interferometry of measuring surface displacements with large spatial gradients, and (ii) the capability of conventional InSAR of being sensitive to surface displacements with limited spatial gradients. Both simulated and real experiments show that the R-SSIaPU method can monitor large gradient mining-induced surface movements with high precision. In the case of the Tangjiahui mine, the R-SSIaPU method agreed with GPS with differences of approximately 4.2 cm, whilst conventional InSAR deviated from GPS with differences of nearly 1 m. The R-SSIaPU method makes phase unwrapping less challenge, especially in the cases with large surface displacements. In addition to mining subsidence, it is believed that the R-SSIaPU method can be used to monitor surface displacements caused by landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and glacier movements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a methodology based on remote sensing data to map and classify unstable slopes in high alpine areas and apply this methodology to the Himalaya of northwestern Bhutan. We leverage on radar images acquired by the ESA Envisat and the JAXA ALOS-1 satellites between 2007 and 2011. Synthetic aperture radar differential interferometry (DInSAR) is used to identify and quantify recent ground surface displacements associated with potentially unstable slopes. Optical satellite images and a high-resolution digital surface model is used for the geomorphological classification of individual landforms and deposits associated with displacements. The analysis of the geomorphological characteristics reveals that displacements are associated with: rock slides, mountain slope deformation and rock slope deformation (77.5%), soil creep (4%), soil slides (1.9%) and rock glaciers (12.3%); 4.3% of the detected displacements remain of unknown origin. The method applied here for the assessment of activity likelihood uses a very large number of interferograms obtained with images acquired by different satellites. The method, which is new and replicable, takes advantage of the combination of different acquisition geometries and then combines indices of vegetation cover, layover, velocity estimate and temporal sampling associated with each detected active area to assign a weight. The analysis shows that a cluster of unstable slopes exists in the northwest, potentially related to the presence of an important regional lineament and the distribution of permafrost. Comparatively little ongoing activity is detected in the south, but field validation documents substantial landslide activity in the recent geological past. The dataset here generated, containing 700 potentially unstable areas with an associated activity likelihood, is a novel dataset that makes an essential basis of future analysis to investigate rock slope instability distribution and predisposing factors. Moreover, this dataset represents a new important step towards future landslide hazard assessment in the Himalaya of Bhutan. © 2019},

	abstract = {With the recent progress in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, especially the new generation of SAR satellites (Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X), our ability to assess slope stability in open-pit mines has significantly improved. The main objective of this work is to map ground displacement and slope instability over three open-pit mines, namely, Hambach, Garzweiler and Inden, in the Rhenish coalfields of Germany to provide long-term monitoring solutions for open-pit mining operations and their surroundings. Three SAR datasets, including Sentinel-1A data in ascending and descending orbits and TerraSAR-X data in a descending orbit, were processed by a modified small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm, called coherence-based SBAS, to retrieve ground displacement related to the three open-pit mines and their surroundings. Despite the continuously changing topography over these active open-pit mines, the small perpendicular baselines of both Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X data were not affected by DEM errors and hence could yield accurate estimates of surface displacement. Significant land subsidence was observed over reclaimed areas, with rates exceeding 500 mm/yr, 380 mm/yr, and 310 mm/yr for the Hambach, Garzweiler and Inden mine, respectively. The compaction process of waste materials is the main contributor to land subsidence. Land uplift was found over the areas near the active working parts of the mines, which was probably due to excavation activities. Horizontal displacement retrieved from the combination of ascending and descending data was analysed, revealing an eastward movement with a maximum rate of ∼120 mm/yr on the western flank and a westward movement with a maximum rate of ∼ 60 mm/yr on the eastern flank of the pit. Former open-pit mines Fortuna-Garsdorf and Berghein in the eastern part of Rhenish coalfields, already reclaimed for agriculture, also show subsidence, at locations reaching 150 mm/yr. The interferometric results were compared, whenever possible, with groundwater information to analyse the possible reasons for ground deformation over the mines and their surroundings. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Underground mining activities usually induce large surface displacements thus causing serious safety hazards and potential ecological damage. The capability of conventional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions and city subsidence has been fully demonstrated, but its application to mining subsidence is limited because of the failure caused by localized surface displacements with strong spatial gradients. In this paper, a new method is presented to utilize SAR pixel Offset Tracking (OT) with a single pair of SAR images to resolve three-dimensional (3D) large surface displacements caused by underground coal mining. Coal mining subsidence theory is utilised to analytically separate the vertical and horizontal components. This method is applied to the Daliuta coal mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, where a dense GPS network is available. Results show the RMS differences of OT derived displacements against GPS in both horizontal and vertical directions are in the sub-centimeter level. In addition, a prediction of mining-induced ground movements is performed with the Support Vector Regression algorithm and RMS differences of 12.4, 13.1 and 14.4 cm are observed compared to GPS, in the vertical, easting and northing directions respectively. The framework demonstrated in this paper is not only able to derive the evolution of the 3D large surface displacements with multi-temporal SAR images in a single-geometry, but also has a potential for short-term predication, which can provide early warnings and promote strategic decision-making for engineering management in the process of coal mining. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Time Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TSInSAR) methods have been widely and successfully applied for spatiotemporal ground deformation monitoring. The main groups of methodological approaches are often referred to as Persistent Scatterer (PS), Small Baseline (SB), and hybrid approaches that incorporate PS and SB concepts. While TSInSAR techniques have long been able to provide accurate deformation rates for various applications, their corresponding performance in complex environments such as mining areas has to be investigated. This study focuses on comparing the performance of three open source TSInSAR toolboxes (Stamps, Giant, Mintpy) over an extended region that includes an active opencast coal mine. We present the deformation results of each TSInSAR method on a Sentinel-1 dataset of 125 acquisitions spanning around 2.5 years over the Ptolemaida-Florina coal mine site that is characterized by several environmental and surface deformation conditions. First, a cross-comparison analysis is presented over different land cover classes. The study shows that all TSInSAR methods are capable for generating similar ground deformation results when the area has stable ground scattering conditions and the dataset sufficient temporal sampling. The most controversial results between TSInSAR approaches were found in land cover classes that include medium to high vegetation. An external comparative analysis between the different results from TSInSAR methods and leveling measurements is also performed. Stamps approach presented the best agreement with the in-situ deformation rates. The Giant approach yielded the best cumulative deformation results due to our a priori knowledge of temporal behavior of deformation in the vicinity of the leveling locations. Finally, we discuss the main pros and cons of each TSInSAR approach and we highlight the importance of comparison analysis that can provide insights and can lead to better interpretation of the results. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new model for three-dimensional deformation extraction of single-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) based on mining subsidence characteristics. The model is applied to address the problem of difficult-to-obtain three-dimensional surface deformations in a mining area with high-precision using single-track InSAR. In horizontal or near horizontal coal seam mining regions, land subsidence and horizontal movement are symmetrically distributed along the strike and dip directions of the working face. The proposed method uses this characteristic to calculate the three-dimensional component of surface deformation for the mining area by performing simple addition and subtraction operations on the line-of-sight (LOS) displacement of the symmetric points. Simulations using the developed model show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the three-dimensional deformations in the vertical, east-west, and north-south directions are 6.9, 5.5 and 8.9 mm, respectively. Experiments were processed using the Sentinel-1A images, and the results show that the vertical displacement generated by the model is consistent with the leveling data. Based on the simulation analysis, it is found that this model can solve the three-dimensional mining deformations, for situations where the strike angle of the coal seam is not perpendicular to the satellite heading. © 2020},

	abstract = {Underground coal exploitation often results in land-surface subsidence, the rate of which depends on geological characteristics, the mechanical properties of the rocks, and the applied extraction technology. Since mining-related subsidence is characterized by "fast" displacement and high nonlinearity, monitoring this process by using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is very challenging. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach needs to predefine an a priori deformation model to properly estimate an interferometric component related to displacements. As a consequence, there is a lack of distributed scatterers (DS) when the selected a priori deformation model deviates from the real deformation. The conventional differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) approach does not have this limitation, since it does not need any deformation model. However, the accuracy of this technique is limited by factors related to spatial and temporal decorrelation, signal delays due to the atmospheric artifacts, and orbital or topographic errors. Therefore, this study presents the integration of DInSAR and SBAS techniques in order to leverage the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of both methods and to retrieve the complete deformation pattern over the investigated study area. The obtained results were evaluated internally and externally with leveling data. Results indicated that the Kriging-based integration method of DInSAR and SBAS can be effectively applied to monitor mining-related subsidence. The root-mean-square Error (RMSE) between modeled and measured deformation by InSAR was found to be 11 and 13 mm for vertical and horizontal displacements, respectively. Moreover, DInSAR technique as a cost-effective and complementary method to conventional geodetic techniques can be applied for effective monitoring fast mining subsidence. The minimum and maximum RMSE between DInSAR displacement and specific leveling profiles were found to be 0.9 and 3.2 cm, respectively. Since the SBAS processing failed in subsidence estimation in the area of maximum deformation rate, the deformation estimates outside the maximum rate could only be compared. In these areas, the good agreement between SBAS and DInSAR indicates that the SBAS technique could be reliable for monitoring the residual subsidence that surrounds the subsidence trough. Using the proposed approach, we detected subsidence of up to -1 m and planar displacements (east-west) of up to 0.24 m. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the investigation and evaluation of geological hazards such as those caused by co-seismic displacement, displacement due to underground mining, landslides, volcanic eruptions, it is important to retrieve the complete three-dimensional ground displacement components. However, both conventional D-InSAR (differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry) and MT-InSAR (multi-temporal InSAR) can only measure the displacement component along the radar LOS (line of sight) direction, which greatly limits the application of InSAR technique. Over the past decades, great endeavors have been made to overcome its limitation of the one-dimensional LOS measurements, and several methods have been proposed to retrieve complete three-dimensional displacement components from InSAR measurements. On the whole, the commonality of the existing methods is characterized by using both ascending and descending SAR data. In this paper, we put forward an approach for retrieving complete three-dimensional ground displacement components from two parallel-track InSAR measurements and present the analytical expressions for the vertical, the North–South, the East–West displacement components. It reveals that the vertical displacement component is just a function of the two parallel-track InSAR LOS displacements, i.e., the vertical displacement component can be retrieved from the two parallel-track InSAR LOS displacements, while the North–South or the East–West displacement component is a function of both the two parallel-track InSAR LOS displacements and the azimuthal displacement. What is more, the proposed approach can effectively improve the accuracy of the azimuthal measurement by using a redundant measurement. As a result, the accuracies of the derived North–South and East–West displacement components are improved as well, which can provide more reliable results for characterizing ground movement associated with geological hazards. In terms of their geographic coverage, there is a strong complementary relationship between the proposed approach and the existing methods. Thus, they can be integratedly utilized in the practical applications. Finally, the approach is illustrated through the retrieval of the complete three-dimensional co-seismic displacement components in an area to the west of Bam, Iran, where a strong earthquake occurred in 2003. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Due to many factors in the physical properties of the ground surface, the corresponding interferometric coherence values change dynamically over time. Among these factors, the roles of the vegetation and its temporal variation have not yet been revealed so far. In this paper, synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data and optical remote sensing (Landsat TM) images over four whole seasons are employed to reveal the relationship between the interferometric coherence and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at five sites that have ground deformation due to mining in Henan province, China. The result showed: (1) As for the village area with few vegetation cover, the related coherence values are significantly higher than that in the farm land area with high densities of vegetation in the spring and summer, which indicates that the subsidence by mining in few vegetation cover area is easier to be monitored; (2) Linear regression coefficients (R2) between the interfereometric coherence values and the NDVI values is 0.62, which indicate the interferometric coherence values and the NDVI values change reversely in both farm land and village areas over the year. It suggests months between November and March with lower NDVI value are more suitable for deformation detecting. Therefore, the interfereometric coherence values can be used to detect the density of vegetation, while NDVI values can be reference for elucidating when the traditional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) could be effectively used. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Earthquake occurrence is usually unpredictable apart from sites in the vicinity of volcanoes. It is not easy to measure displacements caused by seismic phenomena using classical geodetic methods, which are based on point survey. Therefore, the surveying of ground movements caused by seismic events should be carried out continuously. Nowadays, remote sensing data and InSAR are often applied to monitor ground displacements in areas affected by seismicity. The effects of severe nearby mining-induced earthquakes have been discussed in the paper. The earthquakes occurred in 2017 and had a magnitude of 4.7 and 4.8. The distance between the epicenters of the mining-induced earthquakes was around 1.6 km. The aim of the investigation has been to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of ground movements caused by the two tremors using the InSAR technique. Superposition of surface displacement has been studied in time and space. The main scientific aim has been to prove that in the areas where high-energy tremors occur, ground movements overlap. Due to proximity between the epicenters, the mining-induced earthquakes caused the formation of a large subsidence trough with the dimension of approximately 1.2 km × 4.2 km and total subsidence of ca. 116 mm. Two-time phases of subsidence were determined with temporal overlapping. The subsidence analysis has enhanced the cognition of the impact of mining-induced seismicity on the kinematics of surface changes. Moreover, the present work supports the thesis that InSAR is a valuable and adequately accurate technique to monitor ground displacements caused by mining induced earthquakes. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {The article presents a proposal to make simultaneous allowance for both ionospheric and tropospheric corrections in differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) measurements. Atmospheric delay in the interferometric phase may cause the detection of terrain-surface changes to be impossible or significantly distorted. This fact remains of special importance in the case of surface changes that show limited amplitude and spatial range. Two areas were chosen to verify the validity of the proposed solution. The first area includes terrains affected by underground copper-ore mining activity (Poland), which shows high induced seismic activity. Mining tremors recorded in this area cause the terrain surface to locally subside. The authors analyzed three tremors that were recorded in 2016, 2017, and 2019. Each of the tremors exceeded a magnitude of Mw 4.0. The second area is located in the coastal region of Chile, in the Cardenal Caro province. In this case, the authors focused on a series of three earthquakes recorded on 11 March 2010. The strongest of the earthquakes was of Mw 7.0 magnitude. In the first case, calculations were based on obtained data from the Sentinel 1 satellites, and in the second case from the ALOS-1 satellite. It is demonstrated that simultaneous allowance for both the tropospheric and ionospheric corrections significantly improves the final results. The authors were also able to use the analyzed cases to demonstrate that implementation of the corrections does not have negative influence on the range and magnitude of local ground-surface deformations. At the same time, such implementation minimizes local displacement fluctuations and reduces displacement values in areas affected by deformations. The examples used in the article served to show that tropospheric correction is mainly responsible for global corrections (i.e., within the whole analyzed spatial range), while ionospheric correction reduces local fluctuations. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Slopes are formed to carry out mining activities such as stripping, ore production, transportation, and waste management in open-pit mines. The instability of slopes is a potential source of risks for mine safety. An unexpected slope failure may damage people, buildings, and equipment in the immediate area. Moreover, it leads to the disruption of mining production and an increase in production cost. For this reason, the regular examination and systematic monitoring of slopes should be performed to determine the early warning signs of failure. Thus, it may be possible to reach acceptable risk levels and to plan and implement the necessary safety measures. In this study, deformations at a common dump site of three different open-pit marble mines located in Eliktekke region of Amasya province (Turkey) were investigated by the permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique using satellite radar images. The results obtained from the PSI technique were compared with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry results which had been conducted by Hastaoğlu et al. (2019) in the same study area. Velocities in the satellite line of sight (LOS) direction approaching –70 mm/month were determined from the PSI results of this dump site. Although the obtained results provided the overall coherence at this site, different results were found from GNSS and UAV photogrammetry in the areas where step geometry (height, width, inclination) changed along with the ongoing dumps and frequently changing surface topography due to dumping. While deformations occurring in slow motion and in a long time could be revealed by the PSI technique, displacements that occurred instantly and in a short time could not be determined. This study showed the detectability of surface deformations in open-pit mines by the PSI technique and problems that might be encountered during the analysis stage. © TÜBİTAK.},

	abstract = {The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced over Europe are being used to develop pan-national ground motion services. However, simple analysis techniques like thresholding cannot detect and classify complex deformation signals reliably making providing usable information to a broad range of nonexpert stakeholders a challenge. Here, we explore the applicability of deep learning approaches by adapting a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect deformation in a national-scale velocity field. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the U.K. where previously identified deformation is associated with coal-mining, ground water withdrawal, landslides, and tunneling. The sparsity of measurement points and the presence of spike noise make this a challenging application for deep learning networks, which involve calculations of the spatial convolution between images. Moreover, insufficient ground truth data exist to construct a balanced training data set, and the deformation signals are slower and more localized than in previous applications. We propose three enhancement methods to tackle these problems: 1) spatial interpolation with modified matrix completion; 2) a synthetic training data set based on the characteristics of the real U.K. velocity map; and 3) enhanced overwrapping techniques. Using velocity maps spanning 2015-2019, our framework detects several areas of coal mining subsidence, uplift due to dewatering, slate quarries, landslides, and tunnel engineering works. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed framework to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

Its advantages include high-frequency data acquisition and high spatial density, providing maps of displacement. The implementation of this tool for civil projects in remote areas and under severe weather conditions present several challenges. This paper presents the implementation of GB-InSAR, particularly using discrete monitoring campaigns and temporal aggregation of data, for resolving logistical issues associated with power availability. This was implemented to monitor a very slow-moving (average displacement rate of ~10 mm/y) 2 to 3 million m3 bedrock landslide known as The Checkerboard Creek Rock Slope located within the Revelstoke dam reservoir, BC, Canada. GB-InSAR deployment has been successful as it confirmed the toppling-like deformation mode, improved definition of the most active area within the exposed slope cut, improved understanding of the seasonality observed in some instruments at the site, and identification of a potential unstable block north of the known active area. Further, the findings in this paper verify the feasibility of implementing GB-InSAR technology to monitor similar slopes associated with the safety of civil infrastructure and in challenging conditions characteristic of the Canadian environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the potential of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to identify precursors to catastrophic slope failures. To date, early-warning has mostly relied on the availability of detailed, high-frequency data from sensors installed in situ. The same purpose could not be chased through spaceborne monitoring applications, as these could not yield information acquired in sufficiently systematic fashion. Here we present three sets of Sentinel-1 constellation images processed by means of multi-interferometric analysis. We detect clear trends of accelerating displacement prior to the catastrophic failure of three large slopes of very different nature: an open-pit mine slope, a natural rock slope in alpine terrain, and a tailings dam embankment. We determine that these events could have been located several days or weeks in advance. The results highlight that satellite InSAR may now be used to support decision making and enhance predictive ability for this type of hazard. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry – PSI have been largely employed to predict instabilities and failure in open pit mines. The PSI is a powerful technique, which combines radar satellite data in order to detect and monitor tiny surface displacements over vast areas. In the last years, the Sentinel-1 radar mission have produced images of the globe acquired with different spatial and temporal resolutions that are now freely available. In recent years, the footwall slopes of the Riacho dos Machados Gold Mine – MRDM (Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil) have recorded large planar failures controlled by foliation planes. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to evaluate a stack of 39 Interferometric Wide Sentinel-1 scenes, spanning from January 2018 to April 2019, acquired in descending orbit geometry, for the detection and monitoring of surface displacements. The results have shown that descending IW Sentinel-1 scenes can be used to provide a broad picture of the Line-Of-Sight-LOS deformation phenomena. In order to monitor the evolution of the deformation phenomena induced by mining activities, LOS deformation maps with millimeter accuracy could be only delivered at least every 12 days. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

	abstract = {The hydro-mechanical coupling in the shallow crust influences both geological processes such as earthquakes and landslides and anthropogenic processes such as induced seismicity and mining-produced subsidence. Yet there have been few direct field observation to illustrate how the hydraulic and the mechanical processes are coupled. In this study we use continuous water level data from wells and ground deformation data over a large area (>71 km2) of active coal mining in NW China to examine hydro-mechanical coupling in the shallow crust. We present detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater and surface deformation from radar remote sensing in an actively and intensely mined area, and we show that the phase shift of the tidal response of water level may respond significantly to mining disturbances when the excavation workface was many hundred meters to >1 km away, whereas significant ground deformation and water-level drops occurred only when the workface came much closer to the wells. Water level and tidal response recovered after the workface moved away but the subsidence is permanent. We suggest that the permeability of the mined crust may be controlled by narrow conductive fractures that open and close in response to deviatoric stresses, while large ground deformation and water-level drops may be controlled by larger fractures and faulting. One possibility is the release of the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks by faulting, may have allowed the conductive fractures to close and the water level and its tidal response to recover after the workface moved away. Another possible mechanism is the mobilization of precipitates in clogged fractures by dynamic waves associated with mining-induced seismicity, which may change the permeability of fractures. More studies are warranted for a better understanding of the hydro-mechanical coupling during longwall mining. © 2020},

	abstract = {An earthquake with a magnitude of Ms 6.0 and shallow focal depth of ∼4 km struck the Changning county, Sichuan province, China on 2019 June 17. The hypocentre is located in the fold-and-thrust belt with plentiful shale gas and salt mine resources. One hypothesis is that the shallow fault could be affected by the artificial pressure water injection including the disposal of wastewater, fracking shale gas extraction and salt mining in Changning area. In this study, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, historical earthquakes, aftershocks and seismic reflection data were collected to jointly investigate the characteristics of the 2019 Changning earthquake. The source model inferred from the InSAR coseismic deformation observation reveals that the 2019 Changning earthquake is attributed to a blind fault dipping to southwest with dominant thrust and sinistral strike slip. Moreover, a small shallow fault developing within the Changning anticline was triggered by the main shock, which contributed to the surface displacements as observed in the north of the epicentre. The estimated maximum slip of.49 m is located at the depth of ∼1.9 km, ∼9 km northwest of the epicentre. The Coulomb failure stress change caused by the previous two large earthquakes, which occurred in the hydraulic fracturing area, suggesting that they have little effect on the initial rupture of the 2019 Changning earthquake. Despite this, they have a positive triggering effect on the fault rupture in the northwest of the seismogenic fault. In addition, the analysis on the relation between the positive Coulomb failure stress change and the aftershocks suggests that the aftershocks may have different motion patterns from the main shock. The analysis also shows the earthquakes occurrence in the seismogenic zone may be affected by the high pore pressure due to the long-term injection of salt mining for more than three decades.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The legalized mining operation, with foreign companies such as South Development Company (SADCO) and national companies such as the Associated Industrial Mining Company (CIMA), exploited the mines legally until they dissolved and gave rise to small associations, artisanal mining, and, with them, illegal mining. Illegal underground mining is generated without order and technical direction, and cuts mineralized veins in andesitic rocks, volcanic breccia, tuffs and dacitic porphyry that have been intensely weatherized from surface to more than 80 meters depth. These rocks have become totally altered soils and saprolites, which have caused the destabilization of the mining galleries and the superficial collapse of the topographic relief. The illegal miners, called "Sableros", after a period of exploitation at one site, when the gold grade decreased, abandon these illegal mines to begin other mining work at other sites near mineralized veins or near legalized mining galleries in operation. Due to this anthropic activity of illegal exploitation through the mining galleries and "piques" that remain under the colonial center of the city, sinkings have occurred in various sectors detected and reported in various technical reports since 1995. The Ecuadorian Government has been unable to control these illegal mining activities. The indicators of initial subsidence of the terrain are small movements that accumulate over a time and that can be detected with InSAR technology in large areas, improving the traditional detection performed with geodetic instrumentation such as total stations and geodetic marks. Recent subsidence at Fe y Alegria-La Immaculada School, the city's hospital and Gonzalo Pizarro Street, indicates that there is active subsidence in these and other sectors of the city. The dynamic triggers that have possibly accelerated the rate of subsidence and landslides on the slopes are earthquakes (5 to 6 Mw) and heavy rains in deforested areas. Although several sinks and active subsidence caused by underground mining were detected in these sectors and in other sectors in previous decades, which were detailed in various reports of geological hazards prepared by specialized institutions, underground mining has continued under the colonial city center. In view of the existing risk, this article presents a forecasting methodology for the constant monitoring of long-term soil subsidence, especially in the center of the colonial city, which is a national cultural heritage and candidate for the cultural heritage of humanity. This is a proposal for the use of synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) for the subsidence analysis of topographic relief in the colonial area of the city of Zaruma by illegal mining galleries. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Induced seismicity is one of the negative phenomena caused by anthropogenic activities that include mining of minerals. This phenomenon manifests itself as sudden and unpredictable shocks of rock mass, which can cause surface deformation and damage to ground infrastructure. Until the advent of satellite radar interferometry that enables analysis of historical events, the characteristics of these unexpected surface deformations were difficult to assess. The main aim of the research was the spatial analysis of the geometry of surface displacements caused by eight induced tremors in the Rudna copper mine (SW Poland) and the dependence of deformation characteristics (vertical displacements, extent) on the induced shock energy. For this purpose, Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, the differential radar satellite interferometry (DInSAR) method and geographic information systems (GIS) based spatial statistics were used. Vertical displacements were mapped on the basis of 37 calculated interferograms. Spatial statistics on the pixel-to-pixel level were performed in the GIS Map Algebra environment. In the result, descriptive and spatial statistics characterizing deformations caused by individual shocks were calculated. The average values of vertical displacements ranged from −44 to −119 mm. Strong, statistical correlation between the extent, maximum vertical displacement, and energy values was determined. In addition, geometries of the formed deformation areas were analyzed and presented graphically. The results obtained in this research constitute development of a knowledge base on surface displacements caused by induced tremors in underground copper mining. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {A ca. 2.5 million m3 landslide occurred in August 2018 in the Yerba Loca valley, Andes Main Cordillera (33° 15′ S), at about 4000 m a.s.l. The Yerba Loca landslide is a multirotational slide, with a main scarp and failure surface developed in a volcanic rock mass, with secondary scarps and tilted blocks disturbing the colluvial soil cover. No clear trigger could be identified, although the failure took place some weeks after the largest winter precipitation and a sequence of snowfall and snowmelt, in the context of a severe drought. Inspection of optical satellite images suggests that the landslide suffered slow deformation for at least 15 years, increasing in the months prior to the failure. To corroborate these precursor deformations, InSAR analyses were performed at two time and spatial scales. For over 3 years, deformation in the landslide area was detected, while the local, short-term analysis from the 7 months before failure shows line-of-sight deformation rates at the landslide site of over 10 cm/year. Deformation continues after the failure with decreasing speed, with indications of further activity and expansion of the failure zone. This implies a hazard of rock avalanche, debris flows and/or river damming and subsequent outburst floods that may endanger communities downstream. The Yerba Loca landslide is an example of rock slope failure in paraglacial conditions and the influence of climatic factors in the context of climate change for the central Andes. This event represents an opportunity for learning on landslide mechanisms, remote sensing monitoring and hazard assessment of slow, large volume landslides in the Andean highlands. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

This paper uses different methods for atmospheric phase screen (APS) compensation based on studies of ground-based radar (GBR) to zero-baseline acquisitions over the Woda landslide in Sichuan, China. This landslide has a steep topography, thick fog, turbulent rivers and strong rains. Data were acquired at the Ku-band using a GAMMA Portable Radar Interferometer II (GPRI-II) in multiple campaigns (4 July 2019–13 July 2019). In 2019, the Miyun open-pit mine was also studied; the maximum deformation reached 4.03 mm/hour. The collected data were processed within one unit based on the small baseline set (SBAS) approach. The experimental results show the following (1) For long-distance monitoring with complex atmospheric disturbances, range- and/or height-dependent models fail. (2) The iterative decomposition (ITD) method can effectively address complex atmospheric disturbances. (3) If the threshold of wavelength is set to be large, the ITD method becomes a stratified model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can be used to observe high spatial resolution one-dimensional (1-D) deformation along the line-of-sight direction from a single-track synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset. With the aid of multi-track InSAR data or a prior model, InSAR can be extended to infer 3-D deformation information, but the temporal resolution is generally limited. This paper presents an InSAR-based method to retrieve high spatio-temporal resolution 3-D displacements over mining areas (hereafter referred to as the MTI-based method). The core idea of the proposed method is to enhance the temporal resolution of the time-series 3-D displacement estimates by fusing multi-track InSAR observations and a prior model. Firstly, we retrieve high spatial resolution 3-D mining displacements from single-track InSAR 1-D deformation observations, with the assistance of the prior deformation model. By applying this approach to multi-track InSAR data over the same area, we obtain much denser 3-D mining displacement samples in time than those derived from a single-track InSAR dataset. Secondly, we propose a generalized weighted least-squares method to integrate the denser 3-D displacement samples, to solve the high temporal resolution 3-D mining displacements, in which the rank deficiency needs to be tackled. Finally, time-series 3-D mining displacements at the chronological dates of all the available multi-track SAR images are estimated. The Yungang coal mining area of China was selected to test the proposed method using two adjacent-track ALOS PALSAR-1 datasets. Compared with the single-track InSAR-derived results, the proposed method not only significantly improves the temporal resolution of the monitoring results by 42.6%, obtaining more detailed 3-D displacements, but it also provides important data support for understanding and modeling the distinctive kinematics of mining deformation and assessing mining-related geohazards. What is more, the core idea of the proposed method will be beneficial to high spatio-temporal resolution 3-D deformation estimation in other geophysical processes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Slope failures pose a substantial threat to mining activity due to their destructive potential and high probability of occurrence on steep slopes close to limit equilibrium conditions, which are often found both in open pits and in waste and tailing disposal facilities. The development of slope monitoring and modeling programs usually entails the exploitation of in situ and remote sensing data, together with the application of numerical modeling, and it plays an important role in the definition of prevention and mitigation measures aimed at minimizing the impact of slope failures in mining areas. In this paper, a new methodology is presented; one that combines satellite radar interferometry and 2D finite element modeling for slope stability analysis at a regional scale, and applied within slope unit polygons. Although the literature includes many studies applying radar interferometry and modeling for slope stability analysis, the addition of slope units as input data for radar interferometry and modeling purposes has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. A former mining area in southeast Spain was studied, and the method proved useful for detecting and characterizing a large number of unstable slopes. Out of the 1959 slope units used for the spatial analysis of the radar interferometry data, 43 were unstable, with varying values of safety factor and landslide size. Out of the 43 active slope units, 21 exhibited line of sight velocities greater than the maximum error obtained through validation analysis (2.5 cm/year). Finally, this work discusses the possibility of using the results of the proposed approach to devise a proxy for landslide hazard. The proposed methodology can help to provide non-expert final users with intelligible, clear, and easily comparable information to analyze slope instabilities in different settings, and not limited to mining areas. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Long-term dynamic monitoring and sustainable prediction of rock salt mines is extremely important in preventing potential geological damages. However, the future prediction of the mining-induced surface displacement after the underground mining extraction cannot be achieved with single Multi-Temporal Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technique, which can only reveal the deformation history during the period of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisition dates. In this paper, a novel dynamic model, namely Dynamic Probability Integral Method (DPIM), based on the integration of Probability Integral Method (PIM) and Weibull temporal function, is proposed in order to predict the future dynamic subsidence for the period which can not covered by the SAR acquisitions. Firstly, the time series deformation over the test salt mine are generated by Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique with use of 43 Sentinel-1 images, and then the functional relationship between the derived deformation and DPIM is established; Subsequently, the unknown parameters, including the PIM parameters and the Weibull temporal parameters are estimated following the genetic algorithm; Finally, the dynamic surface deformation occurring during the entire period of the underground extraction of the test rock salt mine is predicted. Both simulation and real deformation data over Xinhua (a typical rock salt mine in Hunan province, China) have been investigated. The scenario using the simulated data shows that the overall root-mean-square error of DPIM-predicted subsidence is ±3 mm. The real data experimental results show that the maximum predicted vertical subsidence over the rock salt mine was up to 246 mm. The root-mean-square error with comparison to the levelling measurements is estimated as ±7 mm. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The vertical displacements were detected using thirteen Sentinel-1A images that were acquired between December 2016 and May 2017. The validity and applicability of the method are verified by comparing the acquired images with the GPS measurement results. Because of the deformation characteristics of the mining area, a prediction model that is combined with a grey support vector machine regression (GM-SVR) is proposed, and the practical effects of the model are verified using the deformation monitoring results of the study area.

	abstract = {It is a challenge to map large-gradient deformation over mining areas via current InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) techniques. To this end, we present a new method that is combined with the DPM (dynamic prediction model). Our method can be divided into two parts. The core of the first part is a DPM-based simulation and removal for the large-gradient phase. The phase continuity can be restored to a great extent as the simulation has considered the delayed effect of underground mining. In this step, we can determine the DPM parameters following the rule of thumb. In the second, with LOS (line-of-sight) displacement observed from the first part, a multi-objective GA (genetic algorithm) was used to refine the DPM parameters and the subsequent deformation was predicted. Finally, we show an example of the proposed method in the case of a mine in Huaibei, China. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Underground mining is one of the human activities with the highest impact in terms of induced ground motion. The excavation of the mining levels creates pillars, rooms and cavities that can evolve in chimney collapses and sinkholes. This is a major threat where the mining activity is carried out in an urban context. Thus, there is a clear need for tools and instruments able to precisely quantify mining-induced deformation. Topographic measurements certainly offer very high spatial accuracy and temporal repeatability, but they lack in spatial distribution of measurement points. In the past decades, Multi-Temporal Satellite Interferometry (MTInSAR) has become one of the most reliable techniques for monitoring ground motion, including mining-induced deformation. Although with well-known limitations when high deformation rates and frequently changing land surfaces are involved, MTInSAR has been exploited to evaluate the surface motion in several mining area worldwide. In this paper, a detailed scale MTInSAR approach was designed to characterize ground deformation in the salt solution mining area of Saline di Volterra (Tuscany Region, central Italy). This mining activity has a relevant environmental impact, depleting the water resource and inducing ground motion; sinkholes are a common consequence. The MTInSAR processing approach is based on the direct integration of interferograms derived from Sentinel-1 images and on the phase splitting between low (LF) and high (HF) frequency components. Phase unwrapping is performed for the LF and HF components on a set of points selected through a “triplets closure” method. The final deformation map is derived by combining again the components to avoid error accumulation and by applying a classical atmospheric phase filtering to remove the remaining low frequency signal. The results obtained reveal the presence of several subsidence bowls, sometimes corresponding to sinkholes formed in the recent past. Very high deformation rates, up to −250 mm/yr, and time series with clear trend changes are registered. In addition, the spatial and temporal distribution of velocities and time series is analyzed, with a focus on the correlation with sinkhole occurrence. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The issue of monitoring surface motions in post-mining areas in Europe is important due to the fact that a significant number of post-mining areas lie in highly-urbanized and densely-populated regions. Examples can be found in: Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, as well as the subject of this study, the Polish Walbrzych Hard Coal Basin. Studies of abandoned coal fields show that surface deformations in post-mining areas occur even several dozen years after the end of underground coal extraction, posing a threat to new development of these areas. In the case of the Walbrzych area, fragmentary, geodetic measurements indicate activity of the surface in the post-mining period (from 1995 onward). In this work, we aimed at determining the evolution of surface deformations in time during the first 15 years after the end of mining, i.e., the 1995-2010 period using ERS 1/2 and Envisat satellite radar data. Satellite radar data from European Space Agency missions are the only source of information on historical surface movements and provide spatial coverage of the entirety of the coal fields. In addition, we attempted to analyze the relationship of the ground deformations with hydrogeological changes and geological and mining data. Three distinct stages of ground movements were identified in the study. The ground motions (LOS (Line Of Sight)) determined with the PSInSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) method indicate uplift of the surface of up to +8 mm/a in the first period (until 2002). The extent and rate of this motion was congruent with the process of underground water table restoration in separate water basins associated with three neighboring coal fields. In the second period, after the stabilization of the underground water table, the surface remained active, as indicated by local subsidence (up to -5 mm/a) and uplift (up to +5 mm/a) zones.We hypothesize that this surface activity is the result of ground reaction disturbed by long-term shallow and deep mining. The third stage is characterized by gradual stabilization and decreasing deformations of the surface. The results accentuate the complexity of ground motion processes in post-mining areas, the advantages of the satellite radar technique for historical studies, and provide information for authorities responsible for new development of such areas, e.g., regarding potential flood zones caused by restoration of groundwater table in subsided areas. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) mapping of localized ground surface deformation has become an important tool to manage subsidence-related geohazards. However, monitoring land surface deformation using InSAR at high spatial resolution over a large region is still a formidable task. In this paper, we report a research on investigating ground subsidence and the causes over the entire 107, 200 km2 province of Jiangsu, China, using time-series InSAR. The Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide-swath (IW) images of 6 frames are used to map ground subsidence over the whole province for the period 2016–2018. We present processing methodology in detail, with emphasis on the three-level co-registration scheme of S-1 data, retrieval of mean subsidence velocity (MSV) and subsidence time series, and mosaicking of multiple frames of results. The MSV and subsidence time series are generated for 9,276,214 selected coherent pixels (CPs) over the Jiangsu territory. Using 688 leveling measurements in evaluation, the derived MSV map of Jiangsu province shows an accuracy of 3.9 mm/year. Moreover, subsidence causes of the province are analyzed based on InSAR-derived subsidence characteristics, historical optical images, and field-work findings. Main factors accounting for the observed subsidence include: underground mining, groundwater withdrawal, soil consolidations of marine reclamation, and land-use transition from agricultural (paddy) to industrial land. This research demonstrates not only the capability of S-1 data in mapping ground deformation over wide areas in coastal and heavily vegetated region of China, but also the potential of inferring valuable knowledge from InSAR-derived results. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The 17 June 2017 rock avalanche in the Karrat Fjord, West Greenland, caused a tsunami that flooded the nearby village of Nuugaatsiaq and killed four people. The disaster was entirely unexpected since no previous records of large rock slope failures were known in the region, and it highlighted the need for better knowledge of potentially hazardous rock slopes in remote Arctic regions.</p> <p>The aim of the paper is to explore our ability to detect and locate unstable rock slopes in remote Arctic regions with difficult access. We test this by examining the case of the 17 June 2017 Karrat rock avalanche. The workflow we apply is based on a multidisciplinary analysis of freely available data comprising seismological records, Sentinel-1 spaceborne synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, and Landsat and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery, ground-truthed with limited fieldwork. Using this workflow enables us to reconstruct a timeline of rock slope failures on the coastal slope here collectively termed the Karrat Landslide Complex.</p> <p>Our analyses show that at least three recent rock avalanches occurred in the Karrat Landslide Complex: Karrat 2009, Karrat 2016, and Karrat 2017. The latter is the source of the abovementioned tsunami, whereas the first two are described here in detail for the first time. All three are interpreted as having initiated as dip-slope failures. In addition to the recent rock avalanches, older rock avalanche deposits are observed, demonstrating older (Holocene) periods of activity. Furthermore, three larger unstable rock slopes that may pose a future hazard are described. A number of non-tectonic seismic events confined to the area are interpreted as recording rock slope failures. The structural setting of the Karrat Landslide Complex, namely dip slope, is probably the main conditioning factor for the past and present activity, and, based on the temporal distribution of events in the area, we speculate that the possible trigger for rock slope failures is permafrost degradation caused by climate warming.</p> <p>The results of the present work highlight the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach, based on freely available data, to studying unstable rock slopes in remote Arctic areas under difficult logistical field conditions and demonstrate the importance of identifying minor precursor events to identify areas of future hazard.  © Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {High-intensity underground mining generates considerable surface subsidence in mining areas, including ground cracks and collapse pits on roads and farmland, threatening the safety of buildings. Large-amplitude subsidence (e.g., >2 m) is usually characterized by a large phase gradient in interferograms, leading to severe phase decorrelation and unwrapping errors. Therefore, the subsidence on the surface cannot be well derived simply using conventional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) or other geodetic measurements. We propose a new method that combines both DInSAR and subpixel offset-tracking technology to improve mine subsidence monitoring over large areas. We utilize their respective advantages to extract both the spatial boundaries and the amplitude of displacements. Using high-resolution RADARSAT-2 SAR images (5 m) acquired on February 13, 2012, and November 27, 2012, in the Shendong Coalfield located at the border between Shaanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Province, China, we obtain the subcentimetre-level subsidence of the mine boundary by DInSAR and resolve the metre-level mine subsidence centre based on subpixel offset tracking. The whole subsidence field is obtained by combining and analyzing the subcentimetre-level and the metre-level subsidence. We use the probability integral method (PIM) function model to fit the boundary and central mine subsidence to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the mine subsidence. Our results show that the maximum central subsidence reaches 4.0 m (beyond the monitoring capabilities of DInSAR), which is generally in agreement with the maximum subsidence of 4.0-5.0 m from field investigation. We also model the boundary and the central subsidence (the final fitting coefficient is 0.978). Our findings indicate that the offset-tracking method can compensate for the deficiency of DInSAR in large-amplitude subsidence extraction, and the inclusion of the PIM technique helps reconstruct the whole subsidence field in mining areas. © 2020 Xiaobo Xu et al.},

	abstract = {Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are slow-moving rock-mass movements that encompass entire valley flanks or hillslopes. An acceleration of slope movements leading to a potential catastrophic failure poses a threat to communities and monitoring of these slopes is important for early-warning and risk reduction. Therefore, we studied in detail DSGSDs and landslides in the inhabited areas of Pardu Valley in eastern-central Sardinia using integrated remote-sensing techniques, field mapping, and monitoring systems. Space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data using Sentinel-1 satellites identified downslope movement of up to 10 mm per year on Bruncu Pranedda DSGSD (Ulassai). To analyse the DSGSDs at local scale we used high-resolution digital elevation models acquired UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle), supported by structural and geomorphological field mapping surveys. This allowed to create a geological 3D models of the slope deformations. To better understand the kinematics and temporal evolution of deformation of the unstable slopes, a monitoring system, consisting of GNSS antenna, tiltmeter, and extensometer, has been installed along the DSGSDs near urban areas. A distribution of GNSS measurement points in the unstable area and adjacent stable areas has since 2021 provided periodic measurements of the deformation. With continuous acquisition, extensometers and tiltmeters have been recording changes in large block inclinations and movements over prominent fractures since 2021. Historical InSAR displacement rate and monitoring data support our model of rock slope deformation indicating large scale-toppling. Our 24/7 monitoring system could become an essential component of an early-warning system. © 2021, Italian Society of Remote Sensing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry techniques (MT-InSAR) are nowadays a well-developed remote sensing tool for ground stability monitoring of areas afflicted by natural hazards. Its application capability has recently been emphasized by the Sentinel-1 satellite mission, providing extensive spatial coverage, regular temporal sampling and free data availability. We perform MT-InSAR analysis over the wider Upper Nitra region in Slovakia, utilizing all Sentinel-1 images acquired since November 2014 until March 2017. This region is notable for its extensive landslide susceptibility as well as intensive brown coal mining. We focus on two case studies, being impaired by recent activation of these geohazards, which caused serious damage to local structures. We incorporate a processing chain based on open-source tools, combining the current Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) implementation. MT-InSAR results reveal substantial activity at both case studies, exceeding the annual displacement velocities of 30 mm/year. Moreover, our observations are validated and their accuracy is confirmed via comparison with ground truth data from borehole inclinometers and terrestrial levelling. Detected displacement time series provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of corresponding deformation phenomena and are thus complementary to conventional terrestrial monitoring techniques. At the same time, they not only demonstrate the feasibility of MT-InSAR for the assessment of remediation works, but also constitute the possibility of operational monitoring and routine landslide inventory updates, regarding the free Sentinel-1 data. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {With the exploitation of coal resources, ground surface subsidence continues to occur in mining areas, destroying the ecological environment and significantly affecting the daily productivity and life of humans. The differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) technique is widely used to monitor ground surface deformation because of its unique advantages such as high accuracy and wide coverage. However, conventional D-InSAR technology provides only one-dimensional (1D) displacement monitoring along the radar line of sight (LOS). This article proposes a method based on an analysis of the mining subsidence law for true three-dimensional (3D) displacement monitoring by combining D-InSAR and a subsidence prediction model based on the probability integral method. In this approach, 1D displacement, obtained using D-InSAR, is then combined with the prediction model to obtain the 3D displacement of ground surface target points. Here, 3D displacement curves were obtained for the Fengfeng mining area (China) using RadarSat-2 images obtained on 9 January and 2 February 2011. True ground surface displacement was measured simultaneously by levelling when the 152under31 s working face was being exploited in Jiulong mine. Vertical displacement and inclined deformation calculated using the proposed method were compared with levelling survey data and the results showed average differences of 3.2 mm and 0.1 mm m−1, respectively; the calculated maximum displacement in the east–west and south–north directions were 106 and 73 mm, respectively. The spatial distribution of the displacements was in accordance with the mining subsidence law. Thus, the new method can retrieve highly accurate 3D displacements caused by mining subsidence. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Satellite SAR interferometry (InSAR) allows to observe borders of subsidence troughs created in undermined areas. There is a possibility to evaluate a subsidence velocity in the accuracy of a mm/year for the stable reflectors of the radio signal, e.g. buildings. We apply Permanent Scatterers (PS) and Quasi-PS (QPS) techniques for monitoring of mine-caused subsidence in the Karvina area situated in the Czech part of Upper Silesian Basin. We use PS technique as effective for observation of displacements of built structures (e.g. buildings) and QPS for monitoring of spatio-temporal development of subsidence troughs. The results reveal information valuable for an identification of deviations from expected effects of mining activities on the land surface and for the infrastructure which are potentially affected by the subsidence. We perform the processing of Sentinel-1 and high resolution TerraSAR-X to find how the lower spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 SAR affects the reliability of results. The assets of these new sensors, especially the short revisit time, can overcome the basic limits of InSAR methods connected with temporal lags between available SAR images. In previous Karvina area datasets (ERS, Envisat, Alos satellites) the basic temporal step used to be around one month. During such temporal length significant changes occured in vegetation cover or in cultivated soil causing a loss of coherence of radar measurements. In addition to this, the amount of subsidence of Karvina troughs has often exceeded detection limits of the SAR systems. A significant increase of the reliability of evaluated subsidence also in areas with a moderate vegetation cover is expected with the launch of Sentinel-1B since the short-term interferograms would not be affected by a full decorrelation. © 2017, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for estimating the model parameters of the probability integral method (PIM) based on the line-of-sight deformation derived from the interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Then, it applies the settled PIM to forward predict the horizontal and vertical displacements induced by the extraction of a new working panel. The proposed method first constructed the functional relationship between the InSAR-derived LOS deformation and the model parameters of PIM. Subsequently, an improved genetic algorithm (GA), in which gross error elimination was imposed, was proposed, and used to estimate the model parameters of PIM with a large number of LOS deformation measurements. The estimated model parameters and PIM were then employed to forward predict the horizontal and vertical displacements induced by the extraction of a working panel. Simulated experiments show that the rmses of the predicted displacements along the up-down, west-east, and north-south directions are 1.5, 0.9, and 2.5 mm, respectively. Real data experiments over the Qianyingzi coal mining area of China indicate that the predicted displacements are highly consistent with those by field surveys, with rmses of 4.1 and 3 cm for the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. These imply that the proposed approach can be a very promising tool for predicting the mining-induced displacements and will potentially contribute to the assessing and forecasting of possible geological hazards in the mining area. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The republic of Georgia is a mountainous and tectonically active area that is vulnerable to landslides. Because landslides are one of the most devastating natural hazards, their detection and monitoring is of great importance. In this study we report on a previously unknown landslide in central Georgia near the town of Sachkhere. We used a set of Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data to generate displacement maps using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We detected a sliding zone of dimensions 2 km north-south by 0.6 km east-west that threatens four villages. We estimated surface displacement of up to ∼30 cm/yr over the sliding body in the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction, with the largest displacement occurring after a local tectonic earthquake. We mapped the morphology of the landslide mass by aerial photography and field surveying. We found a complex set of interacting processes, including surface fracturing, shear and normal faults at both the headwall and the sides of the landslide, local landslide velocity changes, earthquake-induced velocity peaks, and loss in toe support due to mining activity. Important implications that are applicable elsewhere can be drawn from this study of coupled processes. We used inverse dislocation modelling to find a possible dislocation plane resembling the landslide basal décollement, and we used that plane to calculate the volume of the landslide. The results suggest a décollement at ∼120 m depth, dipping at ∼10° sub-parallel to the surface, which is indicative of a translational-type landslide. © 2014 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rock slopes fail through structurally-controlled mechanisms, global circular failures, or complex mechanisms depending on structural patterns and rock mass damage. Here, structural geology, rock mass characterisation, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), ground-based radar interferometry (GB-InSAR) and Finite Element modelling are integrated to explore relationships between structure, damage and global slope failure at Mt. Gorsa (Trentino, Italy). There a porphyry quarry has been excavated in complex, strongly anisotropic rhyolitic ignimbrite rock masses. The slope was affected by a major rockslide in 2003 and undergoes continuing instability. Site investigations and GB-InSAR monitoring revealed that the 2003 failure was a roto-translational rockslide involving about 400,000m3 of disrupted rock. Structural analysis of TLS and field data shows that the slope is affected by widespread structurally-controlled mechanisms (sliding, toppling, strain localization in kink bands). The non-obvious relationships between structurally-controlled and global roto-translational slope failure mechanisms are investigated by characterising rock mass damage in different slope sectors. A new approach to quantify rock mass damage by mapping the Geological Strength Index and interpreting its topographic signatures in TLS point clouds is presented. A persistent geological marker is systematically mapped in TLS point clouds, and correlations between attitude variability statistics and rock mass damage are established, providing an efficient assessment tool. Rock mass damage increases in kinematic domains affected by structurally-controlled instability (GSI=35-40) and is maximum in areas of ongoing global instability (GSI=15-20). The 2003 rockslide occurred inside a damaged rock mass zone with GSI<35-40, also suggested to be a threshold condition for the onset of global slope displacements by GB-InSAR data. Finite-Element numerical modelling allows integrating available data and observations. It is suggested that rock mass damage induced by local, structurally-controlled slope instability provides the required conditions (loss of structural pattern, block size reduction, cohesion loss) for transition to equivalent continuum behaviour and global slope failure.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is a space-geodetic technique which allows minute surface displacements over vast areas to be detected with centimetric accuracy. Because of these unique characteristics, the DInSAR approach has great advantages over classical geodetic monitoring systems that allow the anticipation of high-risk situations. In the past few decades, it has been successfully applied in many areas of the earth and environmental sciences. However, there have been very few applications of this approach to active open pit mines in tropical environments. In this work, the DInSAR technique was applied to detect and monitor unknown surface displacements that may be occurring in the N4W iron mine, northern Brazil. X-band data acquired from March 2012 to April 2013 during the TerraSAR-X satellite mission were utilized for this purpose. The results were checked in the field and compared to optical leveling data. Due to the consistent deformation pattern observed over a mine waste pile, Pile W, we also performed numerical modeling in order to carry out a preliminary assessment of its theoretical deformation behavior. The results show that most of the study area can be considered to be stable. The numerical modeling indicated that horizontal displacements may be occurring, and that the DInSAR technique can be used to provide an initial rapid assessment of a large-scale deformation field, which could prove to be very useful, particularly in large active mining areas. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Firstly, the line of sight (LOS) deformation was acquired by the POT, while the vertical, eastwest and south-north deformations were estimated by the PIFM based on the LOS deformation. After that, the proposed method was applied to monitor the surface deformation of Daliuta mine lot in China's Shaanxi Province, and the results on 3D large deformation were compared against those obtained by the GPS station. It is found that the root means square error (RMSE) was 16.5 cm in the vertical direction, 12.2cm in the east-west horizontal direction, and 13.4m in the north-south horizontal direction, indicating the proposed method is accurate and reliable.

In this paper, we choose Xu Zhuang mine in Xuzhou city, Jiangsu Province as a test area, using the PS-InSAR method to deal with 15 scenes of ENVISAT ASAR sequential images from 2006 to 2008 so as to extract ground deformation. The experiment results show that PS-InSAR is a useful technique for mining area deformation monitoring even with high vegetation coverage. In the period of 2006 to 2008, the maximum cumulative LOS ground subsidence of the test area is up to 47 mm, and the maximum deformation rate is 23.4 mm/a. © 2013 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {The Eastern Thessaly Plain presents an area of severe settlement phenomena, owing to the over-exploitation of the underground aquifer systems, causing significant damages to national infrastructures and private properties annually. Herein, both Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Small Baselines (SB) interferometric techniques were applied to study the history of ground deformation along the entire plain. Although the area consisted mostly of agricultural land, a sufficient number of point targets was obtained, well-distributed over the entire plain, permitting the recognition of spatial variations of the displacement field in addition to temporal trends. Our findings outline the southern part of the basin as the mostly affected area, whereas local subsidence patterns of lower magnitude were also recognized elsewhere. Episodes of significant ground subsidence, reaching several centimetres within a few months, characterize the deformation pattern of the area. Although average ground deformation rates do not exceed 2 cm year−1, line-of-sight (LOS) displacements of up to 13 cm were observed, occurring during the summer–autumn periods. A geographic information system (GIS)-based post-processing approach for the analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series is presented, by which these abrupt settlement episodes can be identified in both temporal and spatial domains. The analysis allows the separation between rapid subsidence phenomena during the summer–fall season and annual deformation rates, thereby providing valuable information regarding the actual deformation pattern of the area. The results confirm in situ geological observations, highlighting the unique behaviour of the area due to intense water pumping. The study underlines that average SAR displacement rate maps might be inadequate to describe complex deformation scenarios and could lead to misinterpretations. Exploitation of the full capacity of SAR time series by detailed examination of the displacement histories, through a tailored data-mining strategy, could provide valuable information to geotechnical engineers and planners. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The Delaware Basin, an evaporite sequence spanning west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is well known for the mining of potassium salts, known as potash. Several companies operate mines in the region, primarily using room-and-pillar techniques. However, the region’s karst topography is prone to ground subsidence and sinkhole development when triggered by anthropogenic activities. We explored a region of significant ground subsidence encompassing a potash mine. Incorporating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the advanced land-observing satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A sensors, we used interferometric SAR techniques to detect a significant amount of subsidence located in several distinct areas from 2007 to 2011 and from January to November 2016. To investigate the origin of this subsidence, we considered potash mining by analysing the mine operator’s production records. We observed a strong correlation between the total subsidence rate in our area and the potash production rate during 2007-2011. Furthermore, we observed a considerable amount of continuous subsidence during 2016, despite the mine operator suspending potash production on 6 May 2016. As such, the observed subsidence could result in deleterious consequences throughout the region if further action is not taken. © 2017 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The advent of new satellite and data processing techniques have meant that routine, operational and reliable surveys of land motion on a regional and national scale are now possible. In this paper, we apply a novel satellite remote sensing technique, the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset method, to data from a new satellite mission, Sentinel-1, and demonstrate that a wide area map of ground deformation can be generated that supports the regulation of a range of energy-related activities. The area for the demonstration is mainland Scotland (∼75,000 km2) and the land motion map required the processing of some 627 images acquired from March 2015 to April 2017. The results show that land motion is encountered almost everywhere across Scotland, dominated by subsidence over peatland areas. However, many other phenomena are also encountered including landslides and deformation associated with mining and civil engineering activities. Considering specifically Petroleum Exploration and Development Licence areas offered under the 14th Onshore Licensing Round in the UK, examples of the types of land motion are shown, including an example related to soil restoration by a wind farm. It is demonstrated that, in Scotland at least, almost all licence areas contain deformation of one form or another and, furthermore, the causes of that subsidence are dynamic and likely to be changing from year-to-year. Therefore, maps like this are likely to be of enormous use in a regulatory framework to scope out pre-existing problems in a licence area and to ensure that the correct monitoring framework is put in place once activities begin. They can also provide evidence of good practice and give assurance against litigation by third parties. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.},

	abstract = {Instabilities are extremely common in the iron open-pit mines located in the Carajás mineral province, the world´s largest iron reserves located in the Brazilian Amazon. Due to deep excavations in rock products of low geomechanical quality, heavy precipitation, and blasting practices, mining operations in the area present surface displacements that potentially lead to slope instabilities with several risks (personnel, equipment, mining infrastructure, etc.). This paper presents the results related to the N5E mine based on DInSAR Time Series (DTS) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) using a temporal series of 33 StripMap TerraSAR-X (SM TSX) images, and geological information provided from a 3D photointerpretation of an SM TSX and Ultra-Fine RADARSAT-2 (UF RST) stereo-pair, calibrated with field data. Measurement point (DTS, PSI) results were compared with in situ geodetic survey information (total station/prism measurements) and showed good agreement indicating that most of the mine can be considered stable during the period of the TSX coverage. The highest accumulated displacements were spatially related to a thematic unit mapped as a landfill. For other sectors of the mine, lower deformation rates were related to photointerpreted lineaments related to the Carajás fault system suggesting that geological structures can play a key role in controlling some surface displacements. The investigation demonstrated that the strategy based on the use of DTS and PSI techniques integrated with geological data provided a synoptic view of the deformation process that affected the mine. The approach was relevant for ground displacements monitoring of the study area with DInSAR results compared with in situ geodetic measurements showing good statistical correlation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {We used advanced radar interferometry time-series analysis methods, persistent scatterer interferometry and small baseline subset, to delineate areas of ground deformation related to underground coal mining in Springfield, Illinois, USA, and to measure the temporal pattern of deformation. Two satellite radar systems were used: the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1/2) covered a period from June 14, 1992 to August 30, 2000 and the Phased Array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) covered from June 18, 2007 to February 11, 2011. Results from ERS-1/2 processing showed several areas in Springfield subsiding. ALOS PALSAR, however, appears to overestimate deformation, probably because of large baselines and the limited number of images. Many of these areas are likely the result of collapse of underground mine workings and are consistent with reported incidents of past mine subsidence. The maximum deformation rate attributed to mine subsidence for the period from 1992 to 2000 was up to about −4.1 mm/year, while for the period from 2007 to 2011 the rate was up to about −35.9 mm/year. In addition, we discovered a railroad right-of-way south of Springfield that had subsided at a rate of about 3 mm/year during the 1992–2000 period. The measurements of both ERS-1/2 and ALOS PALSAR are consistent with on-the-ground survey data taken from November 29, 1989 to April 23, 2008. Our study has revealed several locations of subsidence likely caused by the collapse of abandoned underground mine workings. Also, the unexpected discovery of ground surface displacement of the railroad right-of-way reveals one of the advantages of satellite-based monitoring, namely discovering unknown deformation areas. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Tailings impoundment failures may lead to catastrophically fatal, environmental and financial consequences. Monitoring the stability of tailings facility is therefore indispensable for sustainable mining development. Particularly, tailings experience gradual consolidation settlement as the pore pressure dissipates and the terrain subsides. However, field investigations and geotechnical analysis at tailings impoundment are limited by sparse field instrumentation due to high cost. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide a full spatial view of settlement rate at millimeter-scale precision with bi-weekly or monthly updates. Here we integrate big remotely sensed data including multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR images of ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR-1, and Sentinel-1A, and SRTM DEM and LIDAR DEM, as well as water level data, to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement over the tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We show that the reclaimed south pond is experiencing enormous quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200 + mm/yr around the low-permeable decant pond clay at the northeast corner during 2004–2011, and the rate decreases to 100 + mm/yr during 2015–2016. The nearly decadal InSAR measurements can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals the long-term exponentially decaying settlement and predicts the settlement process in the near future. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. There is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution surface displacement measurements from InSAR can significantly improve our understanding of tailings settlement process and facilitate the monitoring of dams/infrastructures stability. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, several advances have been made in the use of radar images to detect, map and monitor ground deformations. DInSAR (Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry) and A-DInSAR/PSI (Advanced DInSAR/Persistent Scatterers Interferometry) technologies have been successfully applied in the study of deformation phenomena induced by, for example, active tectonics, volcanic activity, ground water exploitation, mining, and landslides, both at local and regional scales. In this paper, the existing European Space Agency (ESA) archives (acquired as part of the FP7-DORIS project), which were collected by the ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT satellites operating in the microwave C-band, were analyzed and exploited to understand the dynamics of landslide and subsidence phenomena. In particular, this paper presents the results obtained as part of the FP7-DORIS project to demonstrate that the full exploitation of very long deformation time series (more than 15 years) can play a key role in understanding the dynamics of natural and human-induced hazards. © 2013 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Azul mining complex, located in the Carajas Mineral Province, Amazon region, encompasses the most important manganese mine in Brazil. Vale S.A. company operates three simultaneous open pit excavations (mines 1, 2, and 3) in the area, which are conducted on rock alteration products of low geomechanical quality related to sandstones, siltstones, and a lateritic cover. In order to monitor ground deformation, 33 TerraSAR-X (TSX-1) StripMap images covering the period of March 2012-April 2013 were used in the investigation. An advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (A-DInSAR) approach based on persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) using an interferometric point target analysis algorithm was applied, and the results showed that most of the area was considered stable during the time span of the synthetic aperture radar acquisitions. However, persistent scatterers (PS) with high deformation rates were mapped over a waste pile, probably related to settlements, and also along the north flank of mine 1, indicative of cut slope movements toward the center of the pit. A spatial relationship of geological structures with PS was observed for this sector of the mine, given by PS showing deformation rates concentrated along a structural corridor with faults, fractures, and folds related to the Carajas fault system. Though only ground-based radar measurements for wall benches of mine 1 were available for a short time period of the TSX-1 coverage, the PS movement patterns showed concordance with geotechnical field measurements. The investigation emphasized the important role that satellite-based A-DInSAR can play for deformation monitoring and risk assessment in this kind of mining area. © The Authors.

	abstract = {In this study, three highlights of Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) over Germany are presented to evaluate the potential and opportunities provided by this European SAR mission. Firstly, large-scale interferometry across the country is presented and analyzed against atmospheric models from ERA-lnterim and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) to assess the perspective provided by S-1 for atmospheric modeling and large-scale displacement analysis. We then analyzed localized deformations related to anthropogenic activities at two different regions using S-1 InSAR time-series analysis. In the first case study, small-magnitude (mm/yr) displacement related to underground gas storage and landfill compaction in Berlin is investigated. Despite low rates of displacement, Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI) using an extensive collection of S-1 data reflects both the long-term trend and seasonal variations related to dynamics of gas storage in the reservoir. We estimate long-term surface uplift of up to 2 mm/yr between October 2014 and January 2017 and seasonal variations of up to 2 cm due to charge and discharge of the reservoir during summer and winter periods. An old demolishing landfill NW of Berlin was also found to be subsiding with rates as much as 8 mm/yr. The other case study is a brown coal mining area south of Leipzig. Time-series of S-1 data using the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach provides new insights into mining-induced deformations in this region. Our results show rapid subsidence of up to 4 cm/yr between October 2014 and April 2017 in two active open-pit mining areas in the region.},

	abstract = {The study aims at detection, mapping and monitoring of land subsidence in Jharia Coalfield, Jharkhand, India by spaceborne DInSAR, GPS and precision levelling techniques. Using multi-frequency C- and L-band DInSAR, both slowly and rapidly subsiding areas were identified and DInSAR-based subsidence maps were prepared. C-band DInSAR was found useful for detection of slowly subsiding areas whereas L-band DInSAR for rapidly subsiding and/or adverse land cover areas. Due to dynamic nature of mining and adverse land cover, temporal decorrelation poses a serious problem particularly in C-band DInSAR. Specially designed InSAR coherence guided adaptive filtering was found useful to highlight the deformation fringes. Collateral GPS and levelling observations were conducted in three test sites to validate DInSAR measurements and to determine the net displacement vectors. We observed an appreciable horizontal displacement component of land subsidence in all the test sites. For comparison of results, we calculated InSAR coherence weighted LOS displacement rates from the unwrapped differential interferograms of smaller spatial subsets and LOS projected ground-based displacement rates in three test sites. We found good agreement between DInSAR and ground-based measurements except for C-band observation in Dobari test site primarily due to large difference in observation periods and temporally inconsistent land subsidence. Collateral spaceborne and ground-based observations were also found useful for characterization of subsidence phenomena to determine net displacement vector and horizontal displacement component. In coal mining areas with spatially scattered and temporally irregular land subsidence phenomena, the adopted methodology can be used successfully for detection, mapping and monitoring of the subsiding areas vulnerable to future collapse. This will facilitate efficient planning and designing of surface infrastructures and other developmental structures in the mining areas and mitigation management of subsidence induced hazards. © Indian Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic rock avalanches contribute to rapid landscape evolution and can harm humans directly or by secondary effects such as displacement waves. Predicting the volume, timing, and consequences of rock slope failures is therefore essential to managing risk and interpreting landscape response to climatic or tectonic forcing. Here, we synthesize geologic and geodetic observations to document the spatial pattern of movement rates and failure mechanisms at a landslide complex in western Norway, recently identified with systematic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) reconnaissance. A differential global navigation satellite system (dGNSS) and global positioning system (dGPS) campaign confirms active slope deformation with horizontal displacement rates of 1.2 to 2.6  mm  year−1 at four points distributed across the landslide’s ~1.8-km width. Displacement vectors are consistent with landslide movement occurring on pre-existing discontinuity sets, and a broad synform controls failure mechanisms within the landslide complex. Two ~1.5 million m3 blocks are wedge failures, while flexural toppling and planar sliding of smaller blocks occur throughout the landslide complex. Modern movement rates are comparable to or slower than Holocene-averaged displacement rates, suggesting continued steady deformation or stabilization of parts of the landslide with time. However, a large volume failure with typical run-out for rock avalanches would likely reach the subjacent fjord, causing a displacement wave. We suggest that our collaborative approach of integrating a wide variety of geologic and geodetic methods will be useful for more thoroughly documenting additional landslide sites and for making informed decisions about risk management. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Within the PanGeo project (financed by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Program), the Geological Survey of Italy (ISPRA) and the Urban Planning Department of the City of Roma developed a geodatabase and map of the geological hazards for the territory of Roma, integrating remotely sensed data (PSInSAR—Permanent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) and in situ geological information. Numerous thematic layers, maps and inventories of hazards (e.g., landslides, sinkholes, cavities), geological and hydrogeological data added to historical and recent urbanization information were compared to the permanent scatterer (PS) data from the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1/2, 1992–2000) and ENVISAT (2002–2005) descending scenes, in order to produce a ground stability layer (GSL). Based on the PS data, most of the territory appears stable (almost 70 % of PS velocities are within ±1 mm/year). About 14 % of the PSs show positive line-of-sight (LOS) velocities (measured along the LOS of the satellite) between 1 and 3 mm/year and more than 2 % exceed 3 mm/year; more than 11 % of PSs show negative LOS velocities between −1 and −3 mm/year, while about 3 % exceed −3 mm/year (with tens of the PSs showing velocities over −20 mm/year). The GSL is comprised of polygons or multi-polygons (multipart polygons grouping individual polygons under a single identifier geohazard) enclosing areas where geohazards have been pointed out by PS data and/or in situ surveys (observed instabilities), and by polygons enclosing areas potentially affected by geohazards, based on the available knowledge of the territory (potential instabilities). In Roma’s GSL, 18 multi-polygons (covering ca. 600 km2) related to observed instabilities have been outlined, where ground movements could be detected through InSAR data or where landslides and sinkholes are known to have occurred. Other 13 multi-polygons (covering nearly 900 km2) concern areas where the potential occurrence of geohazards was inferred by combining geological and/or geothematic data (potential instabilities). The geohazards mapped in Roma have been: landslides, collapsible grounds, compressible grounds, groundwater abstraction, mining, man-made ground, tectonic movements, and volcanic inflation/deflation. The lattermost is the likely cause of the significant uplift observed in the Alban Hills area. However, this paper focuses on two more currently impending hazards: subsidence and sinkholes. In general, sinkhole-prone areas (areas of dense underground cavities) are hard to discern from satellite data, but can be revealed by ruling out other potential causes of observed ground movement based on in situ data. Subsiding zones are effectively detected by the available PSInSAR dataset over a total extent of about 60 km2, mostly overlapping the recent alluvial areas of the Tiber and its tributaries. PSs show a very different behaviour inside and outside the historical centre. Inside, loading by anthropogenic construction and man-made ground since ancient times has led to an almost complete consolidation of the recent river deposits, marked by modest to absent subsidence. In contrast, outside, subsidence clearly stands out, with negative LOS velocities that, although generally within several mm/year, can locally exceed −25 mm/year. PS data have provided motion information at both a regional and local scale (up to the scale of a single building). Closer to the sea, in the Tiber delta area, velocities increase, especially above recently reclaimed marsh areas, rich in peat and organic clays. Velocities can change significantly over short distances, as in the international airport area, reflecting the local stratigraphic setting. The same occurs in the two subsiding areas located within the Alban Hills volcanic complex, which is generally affected by ground uplift. As a whole, PSInSAR ground motion velocities offer a significant contribution to susceptibility and hazard recognition studies. In particular, such a method provides a fast and effective tool available to local authorities to monitor ground and building behaviour, possibly allowing for timely prevention activities, especially when coupled with appropriate in situ knowledge. © 2015, Springer Basel.},

Located 1 km northwest, a second GB-InSAR system continuously monitors the large Mannen rockslide. The availability of two GB-InSAR positions creates a wide coverage of the rock slope, including a slight dataset overlap valuable for validation. A phenomenon of rock slope breathing is detected in a remote and hard-to-access area in mid-slope. Millimetric upward displacements are recorded in August 2011. Analysis of 2012 GB-InSAR campaign, combined with the large dataset from the continuous station, shows that the slope is affected by inflation/deflation phenomenon between 5 and 10 mm along the line-of-sight. The pattern is not homogenous in time and inversions of movement have a seasonal recurrence. These seasonal changes are confirmed by satellite InSAR observations and can possibly be caused by hydrogeological variations. In addition, combination of GB-InSAR results, in situ measurements and satellite InSAR analyses contributes to a better overview of movement distribution over the whole area. © 2016 The Authors},

The vertical displacements were detected using seven RadarSat-2 images acquired between October 2013 and March 2014. The analysis showed that the accumulated displacement and the maximum deformation rate reached 42 mm and 95 mm yr−1, respectively, consistent with data obtained from levelling surveying. Based on this, a model of the relationship between the level of deformation/damage to constructions and ground deformation due to mining subsidence was developed, and the grade of mining-induced damage to village constructions was assessed. The method described in this paper is useful for determining the grade of mining-induced damage to constructions, which is a key feature for hazard prevention and mitigation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Mining operations in the area have significant areas of rock mass movements and surface displacements that potentially lead to slope instabilities with risks to personnel, equipment and production. Instabilities can be expected due to deep excavations in rock masses of low geomechanical quality, blasting practices and heavy precipitation. In this paper, ground instabilities are monitored through an integrated SAR analysis based on a data-stack of 33 TerraSAR-X images. This approach was designed to monitor distinct displacement regimes, ranging from small to high deformation rates, and to map surface changes, based on variations of radar reflectivity. Results were compared with field information (total station/prisms, ground based radar, geological and geomechanical maps), and the approach showed to be effective for monitoring ground deformation in the region. Due to its capabilities (synoptic view, high accuracy, dense grid sampling), the complementary use of space-based SAR with field monitoring systems proved to be strategic for operational mining planning and risk assessment in this challenging environment. © 2015 The Authors.},

These criteria include both displacement rates and the structural development of the unstable slope. Satellite and ground-based interferometric radars have the potential to measure the displacement of active rockslides. By using several complimentary InSAR datasets, with different viewing geometries, we are able to assess both movement criteria and a number of criteria related to structural development of the bounding surfaces. We have collected five years of high resolution satellite imagery using several viewing geometries for the Gamanjunni 3 rockslide in northern Norway. In addition, we have collected radar using a ground-based radar. The results show a clearly defined block moving as a wedge. However, the decrease in movement velocity and steepness towards the lower part of the slope, along with the lack of visible basal structures, indicates that rock creep acts at the base of the slide body. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

	abstract = {Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are slow moving, hillslope-scale mass movements featuring characteristic landforms such as double-crested ridges and upslope-facing scarps that occur in diverse landscapes throughout the world. Although these deformations have been studied since the 1960s, significant insights to the rates of DSGSDs have only been gained within the last two decades owing to progress in geochronology, remote sensing and instrumental monitoring. Absolute age and monitoring data indicate that DSGSD movements are observable over long-term (≥102 years) and short-term (<102 years) intervals. Apart from creep, an episodic deformation also plays a crucial role, especially in regions with earthquakes and heavy rainfall. Our review also supports the notion of DSGSDs as precursors of catastrophic rock slope failures, given that many of the world's largest rock avalanches have occurred in areas with diagnostic DSGSD features, indicating that sudden collapse was preceded by a prolonged stage of slope sagging. Detailed studies on DSGSDs have therefore the potential for better prediction of catastrophic rock slides and rock avalanches.Future research directions include constraining the lifespan of DSGSDs with absolute age dating and precise high-resolution monitoring of spatio-temporal displacement across DSGSD bodies. It is of great importance to include absolute time scales in the numerical models of DSGSDs. Furthermore, combining remote sensing techniques such as Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry with high-resolution LiDAR scanning and near-surface geophysics offers a promising toolkit for collecting very detailed and accurate data on the short-term deformation rates of DSGSDs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Fundão tailings dam in the Germano iron mining complex (Mariana, Brazil) collapsed on the afternoon of 5 November 2015, and around 32.6 million cubic meters of mining waste spilled from the dam, causing polluion with mining waste along a trajectory of 668 km, extending to the Atlantic Ocean. The Sela & Tulipa and Selinha dikes, and the main Germano tailings dam, were directly or indirectly affected by the accident. This work presents an investigation using Advanced-Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) techniques for risk assessment in these critical structures during 18 months after the catastrophic event. The approach was based on the integration of SBAS (Small Baseline Subset) and PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) techniques, aiming at detecting linear and nonlinear ground displacements in these mining structures. It used a set of 48 TerraSAR-X images acquired on ascending mode from 11 November 2015 to 15 May 2017. The results provided by the A-DInSAR analysis indicated an overall stability in the dikes and in the main wall of Germano tailings dam, which is in agreement with in situ topographic monitoring. In addition, it was possible to detect areas within the reservoir showing accumulated values of up to -125 mm of subsidence, probably caused by settlements of the waste dry material due to the interruption of the mining waste deposition, and values up to -80 mm on auxiliary dikes, probably caused by continuous traffic of heavy equipment. The spatiotemporal information of surface displacement of this large mining structure can be used for future operational planning and risk control. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we identified recently subsiding areas in Jharia Coalfield, Jharkhand, India from the shorter temporal baseline Radarsat-2 C-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data pairs of 2012. Although shorter wavelength C-band differential InSAR (DInSAR) is more sensitive to slow deformation and better suited for higher precision land subsidence measurement, the dynamic and adverse land cover in mining areas and resulting temporal decorrelation problem poses a serious problem for DInSAR observation in mining areas. We used smaller temporal baseline data pairs and adopted InSAR coherence-guided incremental filtering with smaller moving windows to highlight the deformation fringes over temporal decorrelation noise. We identified the deformation fringes and validated them based on ground information to prepare the land subsidence map of the coalfield in 2012. Several new, previously unreported subsidence areas were detected in the present study with a total subsiding area of 6.9 km2. The recent incidence of roof collapse on 15 November 2014 at Angar Patra village in Katras region of the coalfield where 45 houses collapsed and 10 people were injured is situated in a highly subsiding vulnerable area as obtained from the present study. Due to spatial discontinuities of InSAR coherence, DInSAR phase unwrapping for the entire study area in one go did not appear feasible. To avoid this problem, we performed DInSAR processing in smaller spatial subsets and unwrapping of the subset interferograms by a ‘minimum cost flow’ algorithm. Subsequently, we plotted unwrapped phase profiles across the deformation fringes and retrieved the maximum deformation phase with respect to background phase and translated them into radar line of sight (LOS) displacement rates. For obtaining the average subsidence rates, we adopted InSAR coherence-weighted LOS displacement rates taking into account the contribution of each data pair as a function of DInSAR phase quality of the fringe areas. Ground-based subsidence measurements by precision levelling were conducted in four test sites that had been undergoing active underground mining during the observation period. We compared space-borne DInSAR-based subsidence rates obtained by the adopted technique with precision levelling measurements. Overall, the results are found to agree well. In the four test sites with gentle to flat topography, land subsidence occurs at slow to moderate rates due to compression of in-filled material (resulting from sand stowing in underground mining), without any evidence of roof collapse. In such cases, the horizontal displacement component is less significant, and overall surface displacement occurs essentially in the vertical direction. However, we assessed the nature of subtle horizontal strain to infer relative shrinkage or dilation of the land surface which could be additive or subtractive to vertical displacement in DInSAR-based LOS displacement. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for retrieving three-dimensional (3-D) displacement fields of mining areas from a single interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) pair. This method fully exploits the mechanism of mining subsidence, specifically the proportional relationship between the horizontal displacement and horizontal gradient of vertical displacements caused by underground mining. This method overcomes the limitations of conventional InSAR techniques that can only measure one-dimensional (1-D) deformation of mining area along the radar line-of-sight direction. The proposed method is first validated with simulated 3-D displacement fields, which are obtained by the FLAC$$^{\mathrm{3D}}$$3D software. The root mean square errors of the 3-D displacements retrieved by the proposed method are 13.7, 27.6 and 3.6 mm for the West–East, North–South, and Up–Down components, respectively. We then apply the proposed method to estimate the 3-D displacements of the Qianyingzi and the Xuzhou coal mines in China, respectively, each along with two Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar images. Results show that the estimated 3-D displacement is highly consistent with that of the field surveying. This demonstrates that the proposed method is an effective approach for retrieving 3-D mining displacement fields and will play an important role in mining-related hazard prevention and environment assessment under limited InSAR acquisitions. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The analysis has been mostly performed in a rural environment affected by ground movements with different patterns, magnitudes and causes. A total of fifty SAR images recorded between 1995 and 2007 were processed to generate the interferograms. In order to study the non-linear trends or changes of the ground surface behavior, the DInSAR technique was applied in two sets of images.The interferometric results, in the form of vertical displacement rate maps, were checked against conventional surveying and GPS measurements. The results present a significant discrepancy in some location due to the wrapping of the phase when both fast and significant deformations occur. In order to avoid the latter effect and improve the accuracy of the results, all SAR images were reprocessed using topographic leveling and GPS data of different monitored points.To support the DInSAR interpretation, a detailed geological reconnaissance of the study area was carried out as well as an inventory of ground movement indicators.Four different patterns of ground movement have been identified: active shifting subsidence associated to the progression of the mining exploitation fronts; residual subsidence on abandoned galleries with a decreasing rate of closure; uplifting due to the intrusion of the salt dome; and sudden ground collapses (sinkholes) caused by the dissolution of soluble materials laying close to the ground surface. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the development of urban expansion in Zhengzhou city, the underground resources, such as underground water and coal mining, have been exploited greatly, which have resulted in ground subsidence and several environmental issues. In order to study the spatial distribution and temporal changes of ground subsidence of Zhengzhou city, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis technique combining persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs) was proposed and applied. In particular, the orbit and topographic related atmospheric phase errors have been corrected by a phase ramp correction method. Furthermore, the deformation parameters of PSs and DSs are retrieved based on a layered strategy. The deformation and DEM error of PSs are first estimated using conventional PSI method. Then the deformation parameters of DSs are retrieved using an adaptive searching window based on the initial results of PSs. Experimental results show that ground deformation of the study area could be retrieved by the proposed method and the ground deformation is widespread and unevenly distributed with large differences. The deformation rate ranges from -55 to 10 mm/year, and the standard deviation of the results is about 8 mm/year. The observed InSAR results reveal that most of the subsidence areas are in the north and northeast of Zhengzhou city. Furthermore, it is found that the possible factors resulting in the ground subsidence include sediment consolidation, water exploitation, and urban expansion. The result could provide significant information to serve the land subsidence mitigation in Zhengzhou city. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Determining the location and nature of hazardous ground motion resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes such as landslides, tectonic movement and mining is essential for hazard mitigation and sustainable resource use. Ground motion estimates from satellite ERS-1/2 persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) were combined with geospatial data to identify areas of observed geohazards in Stoke-on-Trent, UK. This investigation was performed within the framework of the EC FP7-SPACE PanGeo project which aimed to provide free and open access to geohazard information for 52 urban areas across Europe. Geohazards identified within the city of Stoke-on-Trent and neighbouring rural areas are presented here alongside an examination of the PanGeo methodology. A total of 14 areas experiencing ground instability caused by natural and anthropogenic processes have been defined, covering 122.35 km2. These are attributed to a range of geohazards, including landslides, ground dissolution, made ground and mining activities. The dominant geohazard (by area) is ground movement caused by post-mining groundwater recharge and mining-related subsidence (93.19% of total geohazard area), followed by landsliding (5.81%). Observed ground motions along the satellite line-of-sight reach maxima of +35.23 mm/yr and −22.57 mm/yr. A combination of uplift, subsidence and downslope movement is displayed. ‘Construction sites’ and ‘continuous urban fabric’ (European Urban Atlas land use types) form the land uses most affected (by area) by ground motion and ‘discontinuous very low density urban fabric’ the least. Areas of ‘continuous urban fabric’ also show the highest average velocity towards the satellite (5.08 mm/yr) and the highest PS densities (1262.92 points/km2) along with one of the lowest standard deviations. Rural land uses tend to result in lower PS densities and higher standard deviations, a consequence of fewer suitable reflectors in these regions. PSI is also limited in its ability to identify especially rapid ground motion. As a consequence the supporting geospatial data proved especially useful for the identification of landslides and some areas of ground dissolution. The mapped areas of instability are also compared with modelled potential geohazards (the BGS GeoSure dataset). © 2017 Natural Environment Research Council, as represented by the British Geological Survey},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for deriving time-series three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas from a single-geometry interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) dataset (hereafter referred to as the SGI-based method). This is mainly aimed at overcoming the limitation of the traditional multi-temporal InSAR techniques that require SAR data from at least three significantly different imaging geometries to fully retrieve time-series 3-D displacements of mining areas. The SGI-based method first generates the multi-temporal observations of the mining-induced vertical subsidence from the single-geometry InSAR data, using a previously developed method for retrieving 3-D mining-related displacements from a single InSAR pair (SIP). The weighted least-squares solutions of the time series of vertical subsidence are estimated from these generated multi-temporal observations of vertical subsidence. Finally, the time series of horizontal motions in the east and north directions are estimated using the proportional relationship between the horizontal motion and the subsidence gradient of the mining area, on the basis of the SGI-derived time series of vertical subsidence. Seven ascending ALOS PALSAR images from the Datong mining area of China were used to test the proposed SGI-based method. The results suggest that the SGI-based method is effective. The SGI-based method not only extends the SIP-based method to time-series 3-D displacement retrieval from a single-geometry InSAR dataset, but also limits the uncertainty propagation from InSAR-derived deformation to the estimated 3-D displacements. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

	abstract = {InSAR can only monitor relative ground deformations with respect to a reference area. In order to obtain actual deformations, GCPs or stable area is required in the study area, which, however, may be unavailable in the investigating of geohazards associated with underground activities (i.e., groundwater pumping, underground mining, and oil/gas exploitation). We propose a novel approach to estimate actual 2D deformations based on the InSAR relative LOS measurements acquired from cross-heading datasets. The errors induced by the arbitrary selection of reference areas can thus be avoided. The performance of the proposed approach is validated by a series of simulations. By providing the ascending and descending measurements with errors of 2 and 1.5 mm/year STDs, respectively, the RMSEs are 2.1 and 2.6 mm/year for the estimated vertical and east deformations, respectively. A case study is carried out in Cangzhou, China, for estimating the actual 2D ground deformations associated with groundwater pumping. By integrating ALOS ascending and ENVISAT descending datasets acquired between 2007 and 2010, we found that the Cangzhou area experienced ground subsidence of up to 23.4 mm/year in the suburbs but ground uplift of up to 20.9 mm/year in the urban area, both of which are accompanied by considerable lateral deformations. © 2017 Xiaoying Yu et al.},

The study area is located about 20. km east of Rome (Italy) and is characterised by relevant groundwater exploitation for various purposes as well as by the presence of compressible soils immediately below the ground level. Extensive processing at different scales of SAR satellite images (ERS and ENVISAT provided by ESA in the frame of a CAT-1 project) by means of A-DInSAR technique was performed. The time histories of ground displacements, have been analysed in combination with a detailed geological setting of the study area and with the hydrogeological changes occurred in the last decades (as the response to the anthropic stress) based on a large piezometric dataset. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to describe the space and time distributions of the subsidence process. The spatial pattern and deformation rate change is attributed to the following causes: i) the changes in the groundwater levels due to the intensification of mine exploitation (requiring dewatering operations) and ii) the distribution and thickness of recent compressible deposits. Specifically, it is derived that the groundwater level variations drive the timing of subsidence triggering over the area, whereas the local geological conditions control the magnitude of the deformation process. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

It first generates multitemporal observations of 3-D mining-induced displacements from the single-geometry SAR amplitude data set with the assistance of a prior model. Then, a functional relationship between mining-induced time-series 3-D displacements and the multitemporal 3-D deformation observations generated is constructed. Finally, the time-series 3-D displacements are robustly estimated based on the constructed function model using the M-estimator. The proposed OT-SIG provides a robust and cost-effective tool for retrieving time-series 3-D mining-induced large displacements, relaxing the basic requirement of the traditional method that at least two different viewing geometries' SAR data are needed. Finally, we tested the proposed OT-SIG with descending TerraSAR-X SAR amplitude data set over the Daliuta coal mining area in China. The results show that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of OT-SIG-estimated time-series displacements are about 0.22 and 0.11 m in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. These RMSEs are around 5.7% and 10.9% of the maximum in situ deformation measurements in the corresponding directions, which can meet the accuracy requirements of practical applications. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {High-intensity coal mining (large mining height, shallow mining depth, and rapid advancing) frequently causes large-scale ground damage within a short period of time. Understanding mining subsidence under high-intensity mining can provide a basis for mining-induced damage assessment, land remediation in a subsidence area, and ecological reconstruction in vulnerable ecological regions in Western China. In this study, the mining subsidence status of Shendong Coalfield was investigated and analyzed using two-pass differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technology based on high-resolution synthetic aperture radar data (RADARSAT-2 precise orbit, multilook fine, 5 m) collected from 20 January 2012 to June 2013. Surface damages in Shendong Coalfield over a period of 504 days under open-pit mining and underground mining were observed. Ground deformation of the high-intensity mining working faces 22201-1/2 in Bu'ertai Mine, Shendong Coalfield was monitored using small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR technology. (1) DInSAR detected and located 85 ground deformation areas (including ground deformations associated with past-mining activity). The extent of subsidence in Shendong Coalfield presented a progressive increase at an average monthly rate of 13.09 km2 from the initial 54.98 km2 to 225.20 km2, approximately, which accounted for 7% of the total area of Shendong Coalfield; (2) SBAS-InSAR reported that the maximum cumulative subsidence area reached 5.58 km2 above the working faces 22201-1/2.

In order to monitor ground deformation, 33 TerraSAR-X images covering the period of March 2012-April 2013 were used in the investigation. An interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) approach based on permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) using an interferometric point target analysis algorithm was applied. Results demonstrated that most of the area was considered stable during the time span of the image acquisition. However, persistent scatterers (PSs) with high deformation rates were mapped over a landfill probably related to settlements. To validate the PSI data, graphs were generated with the displaced information based on topographic measurements in the field. The graphs showed that the surface deformations during TSX-1 runway coverage are within the miner's safety threshold and do not present a risk of major problems.

	abstract = {Measuring 3-D mining-induced displacements is essential to understand mining deformation mechanisms and assess mining-related geohazards. In our previous work, we proposed a method for estimating 3-D mining-induced large displacements with the surface deformation along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction derived from a single amplitude pair (SAP) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) using the offset tracking (OT) procedure (hereafter referred to as OT-SAP). The OT-SAP method effectively reduces the strict requirements on SAR data of the previous OT-based methods for 3-D mining-induced displacement retrieval. However, OT-SAP is not robust to errors in the LOS deformation, due to the lack of redundant observations. In this paper, we present an alternative approach (hereafter called AOT-SAP) to OT-SAP. The AOT-SAP method involves estimating the 3-D mining-induced large displacements with OT-derived 2-D deformation observations along the LOS and azimuth directions from an SAP of SAR, instead of just the LOS deformation in the OT-SAP method. Consequently, more redundant observations are incorporated in the AOT-SAP method compared with the previous OT-SAP method. The theoretical analysis and experiments based on both simulated and real data sets suggest that AOT-SAP can effectively improve the accuracies of the estimated 3-D displacements compared with the OT-SAP-estimated ones. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The manuscript is addressed to engineers involved in geoecological monitoring for mining sector. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, abbreviated InSAR, is one of the growing technologies that use satellite images in various fields of study such as: lift earth’s crust, digital terrain modelling (DTM), subsidence/strains, landslides or hazards and many others. InSAR can provide extensive monitoring data, from large geographic areas, without using expensive instruments or put humans’ subjects in jeopardy. Most mines can affect the landscapes within different systems, as Geotopes or Geofacies, therefore monitoring the geographic areas from and surrounding a mining perimeter can provide valuable information required for assessing the geoecological effects on the environment. With over a decade experience in mining ecology and many various projects conducted within the Romanian national program of closed mines monitoring, the authors concluded that InSAR Technology combined with geoecological principles represent a good approach to evaluate the severity of mining operations impact referring to topo-stability inabilities of landscape, as a general method. In the same time, for a better understanding, the manuscript presents a case study regarding to tailing ponds topo-stability evaluation as an example of how to link InSAR and Geoecology. © 2019, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

	abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) monitoring results with in situ displacement measurements at the November 1990 landslide at the Boršt uranium mill tailing deposit site after heavy rain. Although the landslide did not directly endanger people, site remediation works were undertaken due to the subsequent environmental problems. Additionally, in situ monitoring with benchmarks was established in order to detect the ground motion of the landslide body. PSI campaigning in the Škofjeloško-Cerkljansko area, where the uranium mill tailing is situated, performed for the purpose of measuring displacements of natural targets near the active landslide area, also detected displacements, most probably indicating a creeping process. When comparing the pre- and post-remediation velocities at the benchmarks located on the landslide with persistent scatterers (PSs) located near the landslide, the rates could be regarded as background. The results show that the remediation works in the form of a drainage tunnel were very effective as post-remediation velocities at the landslide closer to the PSs resembled the velocities of the PSs, while the velocities of the landslide mass above the drainage tunnel slowed down, even to below the background velocities. The high correlation values between the movements of the benchmarks and the PSs also confirm that the remediation works were effective as the fluctuations in the displacement values of the landslide were very similar to those of the PSs. Nevertheless, although there are several limitations in comparing the two different datasets, the PSI technique can be complementary to conventional in situ methods. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Persistent Scatterer interferometry (PSI) represents a powerful tool for the detection and monitoring of tiny surface deformations in vast areas, allowing a better understanding of its triggering mechanisms, planning of mitigation measures, as well as to find better solutions for social and environmental issues. However, there is no record hitherto of its use in active open pit mine in tropical rainforest environment. In this paper we evaluate the use of the PSI technique for the detection and monitoring of mine slope deformations in the N4W iron mine and its surroundings, ParáState, Northern Brazil. The PSI processing was performed with 18 ascending SAR scenes of the TerraSAR-X satellite acquired in the dry season of 2012. The results showed a significant number of widely distributed persistent scatterers. It was observed that most of the study area was stable during the time span. Nevertheless, high deformation rates (312 mm/year) were mapped over the mine waste piles, but do not offer any hazard, since they are expected displacements of meters in magnitude for these manmade land structures. Additionally, it was mapped tiny deformation rates in both the east and west flanks of pits 1 and 2. The main underlying reasons can be assigned to the accommodation phenomena of very poor rock masses, to the local geometric variations of the slope cuts, to the geological contact between ironstones and the country rocks, to the exploitation activities, as well as to the major geological structures. This study showed the applicability of the PSI technique using TerraSAR-X scenes in active open pit mines in tropical moist environment. However, the PSI technique is not capable in providing real-time warnings, and faces limitations due to SAR viewing geometry. In this sense, we strongly recommend the use of radar scenes acquired in both ascending and descending orbits, which would also provide a more complete understanding of the deformation patterns. © 2013 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Displacement maps from multitemporal InSAR (MTI) are usually noisy and fragmented. Thresholding on ensemble coherence is a common practice for identifying radar scatterers that are less affected by decorrelation noise. Thresholding on coherence might, however, cause loss of information over the areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios. If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share similar behavior, it appears important to take into account their spatial correlation for correct inference. The information over low-coherent areas might then be used in a similar way the coherence is used in thematic mapping applications such as change detection. We propose an approach based on data mining and statistical procedures for mitigating the impact of outliers in MTI results. Our approach allows for minimization of outliers in final results while preserving spatial and statistical dependence among observations. Tests from monitoring slope failures and undermined areas performed in this work have shown that this is beneficial: 1) for better evaluation of lowcoherent scatterers that are commonly discarded by the standard thresholding procedure, 2) for tackling outlying observations with extremes in any variable, 3) for improving spatial densities of standard persistent scatterers, 4) for the evaluationof areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios, and 5) for the visualization purposes. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Advanced interferometric SAR processing techniques (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry, Small Baseline Subset) are able to detect and monitor various surface displacements caused by e.g. gravitative mass movement, subrosion, groundwater extraction, fluid injection, natural gas extraction. These processes can e.g. cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, affect ecosystems and agriculture or affect the economic use of the geological underground by influencing the hydrogeological setting. Despite the maturity and operational readiness of the PSI technology it is rarely used in operational workflows of the German user community (e.g. from responsible authorities). In order to support the operational use of this technique a “Ground Motion Service Germany” has been designed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in collaboration with the user community, land surveying agencies, SME and research institutions. A major outcome of this collaboration is the user request regarding a PSI-WAP (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Wide-Area-Product) dataset of the entire nation (approx. 360,000 km2) based on Sentinel-1 data. For this reason the PSI mapping coverage is increased by mosaicking PSI data products from adjacent SAR data stacks. Several case studies has been performed to demonstrate the design of the service. Within this paper one case study regarding the PSI-WAP technique and the calibration/validation scheme is presented. The pilot study is focusing on the built up of an officially approved PSI-WAP dataset. The study area covers an area of > 30,000 km2 and is located in the Northwest German Basin. This is the first time a PSI-WAP analysis is performed in this area. Several natural processes (e.g. compaction of marine sediments, peat growth/shrinkage) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. natural gas extraction, rock salt mining) are causing surface displacements in the study area. The PSI-WAP analysis is based on six adjacent ERS-1/-2 data stacks covering the timespan from 1992 until 2001. Each data stack consists of 49 to 73 acquisitions. A comparison of the PSI results with thematic data (e.g. cumulated volume of extracted natural gas and location of natural gas fields) indicates that a part of the detected land subsidence is caused by natural gas extraction. To summarize, this paper shows i) the design of the “Ground Motion Service Germany” and ii) a pilot study to exemplarily demonstrate a PSI-WAP, the calibration/validation scheme and value-added-products. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The main objective of the present study was to investigate land subsidence phenomena and the spatiotemporal pattern of groundwater resources in an area located in western Thessaly, Greece, by using remote sensing techniques and data mining methods. Specifically, the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test and the Sen’s slope estimator were used to estimate the trend concerning the groundwater table, whereas a set of Synthetic Aperture Radar images, processed with the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry technique, were used investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of ground deformation. Random forest (RF) method was utilized to predict the subsidence deformation rate based on three related variables, namely: thickness of loose deposits, the Sen’s slope value of groundwater-level trend, and the Compression Index of the formation covering the area of interest. The outcomes of the study suggest a strong correlation among the thickness of the loose deposits and the deformation rate and also show that a clear trend between the deformation rate and the fluctuation of the groundwater table exists. For the RF model and based on the validation dataset, the r square value was calculated to be 0.7503. In the present study, the potential deformation rate assuming different water pumping scenarios was also estimated. It was observed that with a mean decrease in the Sen’s slope value of groundwater-level trend of 20%, there would be a mean decrease of 9.01% in the deformation rate, while with a mean increase in the Sen’s slope value of groundwater-level trend of 20%, there would be a mean increase of 12.12% in the deformation rate. The ability of identifying surface deformations allows the local authorities and government agencies to take measures before the evolution of severe subsidence phenomena and to prepare for timely protection of the affected areas. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Mapping of landslides, quickly providing information about the extent of the affected area and type and grade of damage, is crucial to enable fast crisis response, i.e., to support rescue and humanitarian operations. Most synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data-based landslide detection approaches reported in the literature use change detection techniques, requiring very high resolution (VHR) SAR imagery acquired shortly before the landslide event, which is commonly not available. Modern VHR SAR missions, e.g., Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X, or COSMO-SkyMed, do not systematically cover the entire world, due to limitations in onboard disk space and downlink transmission rates. Here, we present a fast and transferable procedure for mapping of landslides, based on change detection between pre-event optical imagery and the polarimetric entropy derived from post-event VHR polarimetric SAR data. Pre-event information is derived from high resolution optical imagery of Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2, which are freely available and systematically acquired over the entire Earth's landmass. The landslide mapping is refined by slope information from a digital elevation model generated from bi-static TanDEM-X imagery. The methodology was successfully applied to two landslide events of different characteristics: A rotational slide near Charleston, West Virginia, USA and a mining waste earthflow near Bolshaya Talda, Russia. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We focus on the use of advanced multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) for mapping and monitoring of ground deformations caused by open-cast mining and hydrocarbon production. We also show how MTI can be exploited to monitor the stability of infrastructure in adjacent areas. Open-cast mines represent a good target for MTI, because they are (1) often very large (from few to tens of km2); (2) free of or covered by sparse vegetation; (3) require long-term regular monitoring. The operational deformation monitoring via MTI can now rely on free of charge medium-resolution Sentinel-1 data, consistently and regularly acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA) since 2014. To illustrate the application potential of MTI based on Sentinel-1 data, we present the case study of the Belchatow mine (Poland), one of the largest open-cast mines in Europe. We stress that thanks to wide-area coverage; space-borne MTI represents a cost-effective approach to monitoring ground/slope instability hazards in large open pits, as well as the stability of the associated engineering structures and facilities. On-land oil and gas fields are also often huge and ground deformations induced by their exploitations can be profitably targeted by MTI. This is illustrated through an example of MTI application from the Middle East that relies on high-resolution (3 m) radar data. The example highlights the possibility of obtaining extremely dense (spatially continuous) information, which is important for monitoring complex ground deformations caused by oil field exploitation. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Land subsidence is a global issue and researchers from all over the world are keen to know the causes of deformation and its further influences. This paper reports the findings from time series InSAR (TS-InSAR) results over the Southern Coalfield, Australia using both ALOS-1 PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and ENVISAT ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) datasets. TS-InSAR has been applied to both rural and urban areas with great success, but very few of them have been applied to regions affected by underground mining activities. The TS-InSAR analysis exploited in this paper is based on GEOS-ATSA, and Measurement Point (MP) pixels are selected according to different geophysical features. Three experiment sites with different geological settings within the study zone are analysed: (1) Wollongong city, which is a relatively stable area; (2) Tahmoor town, a small town affected by underground mining activities; and (3) the Appin underground mining site, a region containing multiple underground mining activities. The TS-InSAR results show that the performance of both C-band and L-band is equally good overWollongong, where the subsidence gradient is not significant and most subsidence rates are between -10 mm.yr-1 to 10 mm.yr-1. However, over the Tahmoor and Appin sites, difference in performances has been observed. Since the maximum displacement gradients that can be detected are different for L-band and C-band-based TS-InSAR methods, some rapid changes could cause the TS-InSAR to fail to estimate the correct displacements. It is well known that L-band can perform better than C-band, especially in underground mining regions and mining-affected regions where the deformation rate is much higher than city areas because of its wavelength. Statistical analyses are also conducted to further prove the above statement. 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Due to the side-looking imaging geometry of the current synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, only ground deformation along the radar's line-of-sight (LOS) and azimuth directions can be potentially obtained from a single amplitude pair (SAP) of SAR using offset tracking (OT) procedures. This significantly hinders the accurate assessment of mining-related hazards and better understanding of the mining subsidence mechanism. In this paper, we propose a method for completely retrieving three-dimensional (3-D) mining-induced displacements with OT-derived observations of LOS deformation from a single amplitude pair of SAR (referred to as OT-SAP hereinafter). The OT-SAP method first constructs two extra constraints at each pixel of the mining area based on the proportional relationship between the horizontal motion of the mining area and the gradients of the vertical subsidence in the east and north directions. The full 3-D mining-induced displacements are then solved by coupling the two constructed extra constraints with the OT-derived observations of the LOS deformation. The Daliuta coal mining area in China was selected to test the proposed OT-SAP method. The results show that the maximum 3-D displacements of this mining area were about 4.3 m, 1.1 m, and 1.3 m in the vertical, east, and north directions, respectively, from 21 November 2012 to 6 February 2013. The accuracies of the retrieved displacements in the vertical and horizontal directions are about 0.201 m and 0.214 m, respectively, which are much smaller than the mining-induced displacements in this mining area and can satisfy the basic requirements of mining deformation monitoring. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Loose deposits may lead to catastrophic landslides and rockslides especially during or after heavy rainfall events. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the volume and spatial distribution (VSD) of loose deposits using airborne and spaceborne optical remote sensing data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence. The estimated VSD of coseismic loose deposits in Wenchuan, China, the epicenter of the Sichuan Earthquake, is then used to predict potential landslides. First, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and digital orthophoto map (DOM) are developed using stereo imagery collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over a core test site. Next, the VSD of loose deposits is determined using the UAV imagery, DEM, and a landslide inventory map developed by field surveys, and a power-law relationship between the area and volume is established. In order to determine the loose deposits of the entire study area, the InSAR coherence of PALSAR images collected before and right after the earthquake, Landsat image classification, and DEM combined with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model are integrated in a decision tree algorithm. Finally, we develop a quantitative method of determining the severity and likelihood of potential geohazards based on VSD of coseismic loose deposits and other variables including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), slope gradient, elevation, and land-cover/land-use (LCLU). A total of 42 catchments area are identified as the hot spots with a very high or high possibility of potential landslides. The VSD of coseismic loose deposits over these catchments is about 92.34% and 77.96% of the total potential loose deposits area. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An improved method combining a probability integral method and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for retrieving three-dimensional (3D) displacement field caused by coal mining is proposed. In this paper, fully considering dip angles of coal seams, we improved the method of obtaining 3D deformation using the linear relationship between horizontal displacement and surface tilt. Compared with the former method ignoring dip angles of coal seams, the improved method is more accurate in retrieving 3D displacement in mining areas. The improved method is first validated with a simulated coal seam with a dip angle of about 25°. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) in the Up-Down, East-West and South-North directions are 23.4, 33.0 and 8.0 mm, respectively. Finally, real SAR data are used to retrieve the 3D displacement fields of the Number 15235 working face of the Jiulong coal mine with a dip angle of about 13°. Due to the lack of field observations to evaluate horizontal displacement accuracy, Up-Down displacement is compared with leveling data. The RMSEs of the improved and former methods are 6.4 and 7.1 mm, respectively. The real data also indicate that the improved method is more accurate. In summary, the improved method is effective for obtaining a 3D displacement field, especially in the inclined coal seams mining area. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This study combines remote sensing data from ground-and satellite-based radar to calculate 3D displacement vectors for the Jettan rockslide, Troms, northern Norway. Using 3D displacement vectors, aspect data and strain rates in conjunction with structure (foliation, faults, fractures), geomorphological elements (ridges, scarps, terraces, depressions), topography and borehole data, we identify zones undergoing displacement, e.g., extension and compression, displacement into-or out-of-the-slope and/or various degrees of tilting. Our results show variable 3D displacement velocities, from north to south, that segment the rockslide into distinct domains. Displacement patterns are structurally controlled, as spatial variation in azimuth and plunge of 3D displacement vectors can be related to variation in attitudes of the host-rock foliation, faults and fractures. In the north, a complex graben system surrounded by orthogonal NW-SE and NE-SW-trending geomorphological elements, shows a repeated stepping 3D displacement pattern. This may indicate a complex fault geometry at depth, including stepped and discontinuous slide surfaces. We interpret 3D displacement into-the-slope in the upper part, and out-of-the-slope in the lower part, to be back-rotation of antithetic blocks with planar fractures becoming curved/listric gliding surfaces with depth. Downslope reduction in velocity indicates compression and stacking of blocks. In the southern area, N-S-trending geomorphological elements are arranged parallel to the hillslope. 3D displacement vectors show a more homogenous displacement pattern indicating movement along planar, hillslope-parallel, fracture sets at depth. We propose a structuralcontrolled slope displacement model including alternate planar-and wedge-failure, in addition to displacement along planar and listric fractures merging into foliation at depth. Using the Jettan rockslide as a case study, we show how remote sensing data may aid examination of structural and topographic controls on rockslide kinematics, thus giving new insights into subsurface geometry. © The authors.},

	abstract = {Landslides are geomorphological phenomena that affect anthropogenic and natural features on the Earth’s surface. Many previous studies have identified several factors that have contributed to landslides. Among these factors are physical characteristics, such as slope, aspect, and land cover, of Earth’s surface. Moreover, landslides can be triggered by human activities such as underground mining. This study aims to identify landslide susceptibility areas by analyzing landslide-related factors, including land subsidence triggered by underground mining. The area of interest was Kozlu, Turkey, where underground mining has been in progress for the past 100 years. Thus, to identify landslide risk zones, the multicriteria decision analysis method, together with the analytical hierarchy method, was used. The datasets included were topography, land cover, geological settings, and mining-induced land subsidence. The spatial extent of land subsidence was estimated using a previously published model. A landslide susceptibility map (LSM) was developed using a purposely developed GIS-based software. The results were compared with a terrain deformation map, which was developed in a separate study using the differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) technique. The results showed a substantial correlation between the LSM and DInSAR map. Furthermore, it was found that ~ 88% of the very high and high landslide risk areas coincided with location of the past landslide events. These facts suggest that the algorithm and data sources used were sufficient to produce a sufficiently accurate LSM, which may be used for various purposes such as urban planning. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Toppling failure of rock slopes is a complicated mode due to a combination of both continuous and discontinuous deformation, especially in dealing with anti-dip rock slopes. In this paper, a novel continuum-based discrete element method (CDEM), which is useful in modeling the entire progressive process from continuous to discontinuous deformation, is proposed to analyze the deformation characteristics, the failure mechanism and the evolution process of a large-scale open pit slope with a typical anti-dip structure. To simulate the slope deformation, the shear strength reduction method (SSR) is adopted to represent the strength degradation of rock mass in the deterioration process. The simulated results are validated using data obtained from a field investigation and continuous monitoring by employing an advanced remote sensing technique called ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (GB-InSAR). To analyze the evolution trend of the anti-dip slope, the subsequent toppling failure mode is predicted using the validated CDEM models. Based on a case study of a slope at the Fushun open pit mine (in Fushun, China), the unique geological structure with various joints and discontinuities, groundwater, intense rainfall, and mining activities are identified as the main triggers for different failure stages. The comparison between the field data and the simulation shows that CDEM accurately depicts the rock deformation and the failure pattern of the studied slope. The proposed numerical modeling techniques can be used for predicting failures of other similar excavated rock slopes. The simulated evolution process and the recorded deformation patterns help engineers to gain a better understanding of rock mass movement of anti-dip slopes, and the presented methodology could be utilized for similar studies and engineering designs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

The combined techniques were applied in an open pit iron mine located in Carajás Mineral Province (Brazilian Amazon region), using a set of 33 TerraSAR-X-1 images acquired from March 2012 to April 2013 when, due to a different deformation behavior during the dry and wet seasons in the Amazon region, a non-linear deformation was detected. The DTS analysis was performed on a stack of multi-look unwrapped interferograms using an extension of the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), where a set of additional weighted constraints on the acceleration of the displacement was incorporated to control the smoothness of the time-series solutions, whose objective was to correct the atmospheric phase artifacts. The height errors and the deformation history provided by the DTS technique were used as previous information to perform the PSI analysis. This procedure improved the capability of the PSI technique to detect non-linear movement as well as to increase the numbers of point density of the final results.

	abstract = {This paper presents application of satellite interferometric methods (persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR™) and differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR)) for observation of ground deformation in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) in Southern Poland. The presented results were obtained during the DORIS project (EC FP 7, Grant Agreement n. 242212, www.doris-project.eu). Several InSAR datasets for this area were analysed. Most of them were processed by Tele-Rilevamento Europa - T.R.E. s.r.l. Italy. Datasets came from different SAR satellites (ERS 1 and 2, Envisat, ALOS- PALSAR and TerraSAR-X) and cover three different SAR bands (L, C and X). They were processed using both InSAR techniques: DInSAR, where deformations are presented as interferometric fringes on the raster image, and PSInSAR, where motion is indentified on irregular set of persistent scatterer (PS) points. Archival data from the C-band European Space Agency satellites ERS and ENVISAT provided information about ground movement since 1992 until 2010 in two separate datasets (1992–2000 and 2003–2010). Two coal mines were selected as examples of ground motion within inactive mining areas: Sosnowiec and Saturn, where mining ceased in 1995 and 1997, respectively. Despite well pumping after closure of the mines, groundwater rose several dozen meters, returning to its natural horizon. Small surface uplift clearly indicated on satellite interferometric data is related to high permeability of the hydrogeological subregion and insufficient water withdrawal from abandoned mines. The older 1992–2000 PSInSAR dataset indicates values of ground motion ranging from –40.0 to 0.0 mm. The newer 2003–2010 dataset shows values ranging from –2.0 to +7.0 mm. This means that during this period of time subsidence was less and uplift greater in comparison to the older dataset. This is even more evident in the time series of randomly selected PS points from both coal mines. The presence of bentonite deposits in the Saturn coal mine can also have influence on the ground surface uplift. Analysis of interferometric L and X-band data in Upper Silesia has enabled observation and monitoring of the underground mining front for several months. It was indicated by the example from the Halemba–Wirek coal mine. Analysis of the TerraSAR–X dataset processed by SqueeSAR algorithms proved to be the most effective for this purpose. X-band persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) time series can help to indentify small seemingly negligible movements and are successfully supplemented by fringes when displacement becomes significant. Differential interferograms from the L-band dataset detect similar displacement values but, thanks to longer wavelength, are characterized by better coherence, especially in the middle of the subsidence trough. Results on ground deformation proved that ground motion above abandoned mines continues long after their closure. Therefore, existing regulations stating that abandoned mines are considered fully safe five years after mine closure should change. Moreover, it should be emphasised that construction in these areas should be avoided due to existing potential risks. © 2014, Springer Basel.},

	abstract = {abstarct: The Datong basin is one of the complex geologic environments in China. Several faults are distributed in the basin, and a number of hidden faults have been discovered within the basin. Ground fissures (GFs) and land subsidence occur in this region. In the past, ground subsidence at Datong basin has been studied using groundwater level records, intermittent small-scale levelling measurements and field investigations. However, due to the low spatial resolution and temporal sampling of these records, detailed ground deformation within the basin remains poorly understood. In this study, we exploited Envisat ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images to map the ground deformation between 2007 and 2010. Most of the deformation within the basin occurred at rates of <20 mm/year. In addition to the subsidence due to coal mining in the western mountainous areas, at least four large subsidence zones could be detected. Our analysis indicates that the ground subsidence is affected by groundwater extraction and the distribution of faults. Additionally, the vertical deformation is much larger than the deformation in the east–west direction. Obvious deformation gradients occurred on individual GFs and the activity of the GFs varied spatially. Finally, Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations related to groundwater exploitation and GFs were modelled and discussed.

	abstract = {Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) analysis of a large area is always a challenging task regarding the removal of the atmospheric phase component. This work presents an investigation of ground movement measurements based on a combination of differential SAR interferometry time-series (DTS) and PSI techniques, applied on a large area of extent with open pit iron mines located in Carajás (Brazilian Amazon Region), aiming at detecting linear and nonlinear ground movement. These mines have presented a history of instability, and surface monitoring measurements over sectors of the mines (pit walls) have been carried out based on ground-based radar and total station (prisms). Using a priori information regarding the topographic phase error and a phase displacement model derived from DTS, temporal phase unwrapping in the PSI processing and the removal of the atmospheric phases can be performed more efficiently. A set of 33 TerraSAR-X (TSX-1) images, acquired during the period from March 2012 to April 2013, was used to perform this investigation. The DTS analysis was carried out on a stack of multilook unwrapped interferograms using an extension of SVD to obtain the least-square solution. The height errors and deformation rates provided by the DTS approach were subtracted from the stack of interferograms to perform the PSI analysis. This procedure improved the capability of the PSI analysis for detecting high rates of deformation, as well as increased the numbers of point density of the final results. The proposed methodology showed good results for monitoring surface displacement in a large mining area, which is located in a rain forest environment, providing very useful information about the ground movement for planning and risk control. © 2017 The Authors.},

A total of 13 ERS-1/-2 SAR images were acquired between August 22, 1996 and December 14, 2000 over two uranium mill tailings sites located in north-western New Mexico, USA. These SAR datasets were screened based on meteorological conditions at the time of acquisition, eliminating those acquired during (a) rain and thunderstorms, (b) mist or fog or, (c) during overcast conditions. Preliminary coherence analysis allowed us to better understand the dynamics of land disposal sites, to identify useful and relevant time domains and define the appropriate parameters for subsequent InSAR analyses. DInSAR allowed us to measure differential settlement of tens of mm over two 3 to 4. month periods. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) technique identified spatial variations in the rate of settlement ranging from approximately. 1. mm/yr to 10. mm/yr. Although the extent of the analysis was limited by the availability of archived SAR data, the results demonstrated that monitoring using on-demand SAR data should yield reliable measurements of surface displacements earthen covers. © 2015 The Authors.},

We collected 23 ascending Multi-Look Fine 3 Far (MF3F) and 15 descending Standard 3 (S3) RADARSAT-2 images and performed time-series analysis utilizing Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and Multidimensional SBAS (MSBAS) methodologies. We observed two well-defined circular regions located a few kilometers apart and subsiding with the nearly constant rate of about 10 cm yr-1. MSBAS decomposition revealed the presence of both vertical and horizontal ground displacements. For further analysis we selected two highly coherent interferograms spanning from November to December 2009 until April 2010 thanks to particularly favorable ground conditions that displayed superior coherence. We performed modeling and inversion assuming spherical and sill source models in order to determine the source location, depth and strength. The sill source model produced the smallest residual of 0.7 cm yr-1 applied to ascending interferograms and 0.9 cm yr-1 applied to descending interferograms. A residual of 1.0 cm yr-1 was achieved with the sill model when both ascending and descending interferograms were used. This model suggested sources located at 1.3 and 1.2 km depth with radius of 1.0 and 1.3 km for eastern and western areas, respectively. The spherical model suggested slightly shallower sources located at 0.9 and 0.8 km. We could not precisely identify the cause of this deformation, but the observed subsidence rate and source depth suggest mining-related origin. Topographic changes produced by this subsidence rate over a long time may produce shallow groundwater redistribution and flooding of agricultural lands.© Author(s) 2014. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

	abstract = {Mine collapse is a common geological hazard associated with mining areas. This study analyzes mine collapse above the Yongcheng mining area located on the Huanghuai Plain in eastern Henan Province, China. The aim is to predict surface subsidence and evaluate associated disaster risks in goaf with thick alluvial cover. The surface deformation above seven mined coalfields and six unmined coalfields was calculated using the probability integration method. The results showed that the final maximum ground subsidence would be 7.25 m for the Suburban mine and 5.3 m for the Xinzhuang mine. As part of a broader study, land subsidence was also measured over a 1-year period in 2012–2013 by interferometric point target analysis using Radarsat-2 satellite synthetic aperture radar. Interferometric displacement maps were validated with leveling data. Based on the principles of fuzzy mathematics and the analytical hierarchy process, a susceptibility assessment system was developed to define the risk from mine collapse for the coalfields across the mining area. A hazard-zoning map was also produced using the spatial analysis function of ArcGIS. These research results can serve as a reference for farmland reclamation, town planning, and the restoration of the natural environment in this area. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the land deformation in the Gippsland Basin, Victoria, Australia has been mapped using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series analysis with the ALOS L-band SAR data. Land subsidence in the basin resulting from mining activities has already been known over the past few decades. There has been ongoing concern that irrigation and off-shore oil and natural gas extraction has significantly lowered groundwater levels on-shore, and that this may lead to further subsidence. Therefore it is important to map the land surface change in the basin in order to understand the actual impact of these activities. The total area of Gippsland Basin is approximately 46,000km2, where approximately one-third of the basin is located onshore. Because of the large area of the basin, ALOS PALSAR data from 4 different paths were used to map the land displacement over the basin. The InSAR result suggests that the land displacement at 98% of the measurement points in the basin was between -10mm/year and 10mm/year. The InSAR result has been compared to the ground survey data in several areas, collected with GPS and total station surveys. The comparison of results suggested that the InSAR measurement and the ground survey measurement agree with each other in general.The standard deviation of difference between the InSAR results and the ground survey data is approximately 4. mm/year near the coastal area and 15. mm/year near the mining sites. Several rapidly deforming areas have been identified at the mining sites and the surrounding areas. Deformation rate at up to -. 82.9. mm/year is observed in these areas. The deformation at the mining sites and the surrounding areas are expected to be resulted from mining activities and associated mine dewatering. Moreover, several minor displacement zones have been observed and investigated in the area between the Loy Yang Mines and the Gippsland coast as well as the area between Yanakie and Wilsons Promontory. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this work, the analysis of TerraSAR-X satellite images combining both conventional and advanced Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) approaches has proven to be effective to detect and monitor fast evolving mining subsidence on urban areas in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Poland). This region accounts for almost three million inhabitants where mining subsidence has produced severe damage to urban structures and infrastructures in recent years. Conventional DInSAR approach was used to generate 28 differential interferograms between 5 July 2011 and 21 June 2012 identifying 31 subsidence troughs that account up to 245 mm of displacement in 54 days (equivalent to 1660 mm/year). SqueeSARTM processing yielded a very dense measurement point distribution, failing to detect faster displacements than 330 mm/year, which occur within the subsidence troughs detected with conventional DInSAR. Despite this limitation, this approach was useful to delimit stable areas where mining activities are not conducted and areas affected by residual subsidence surrounding the detected subsidence troughs. These residual subsidence mining areas are located approximately 1 km away from the 31 detected subsidence troughs and account for a subsidence rate greater than 17 mm/year on average. The validation of this methodology has been performed over Bytom City were underground mining activity produced severe damages in August 2011. Conventional DInSAR permitted to successfully map subsidence troughs between July and August 2011 that coincide spatially and temporally with the evolution of underground mining excavations, as well as with the demolition of 28 buildings of Karb district. Additionally, SqueeSARTM displacement estimates were useful to delimit an area of 8.3 km2 of Bytom city that is affected by a residual mining subsidence greater than 5 mm/year and could potentially suffer damages in the midterm. The comparison between geodetic data and SqueeSARTM for the common monitoring period yields and average absolute difference of 7 mm/year, which represents 14% of the average displacement rate measured by the geodetic benchmarks. These results demonstrate that the combined exploitation of high-resolution satellite SAR data through both conventional and advanced DInSAR techniques could be crucial to monitor fast evolving mining subsidence, which may severely impact highly populated mining areas such as the Upper Silesia Coal Basin (USCB). © 2015 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Slope monitoring plays an important role in the risk management of large open pit slopes. Historically, displacement data derived from measuring geodetic prisms have been relied upon to delineate the boundaries of potential slope hazards; however that data can be limited by its point-measurement nature. Localized displacements at each prism may be misinterpreted when extended to the behavior of the entire slope, and important displacements between prisms may be overlooked. New technologies like ground-based radar can provide high resolution, full area coverage of a slope in combination with near real-time acquisition and millimeter precision. As a line-of-sight instrument, these tools provide data on displacement magnitudes and rates, but not true direction hence limiting their use in gaining understanding of the kinematics and behavior of the moving slope. This paper describes a novel experiment in which two ground-based synthetic aperture radar systems were simultaneously deployed to record continuous, line-of-sight displacements of an open pit slope in "stereo". The displacement vectors were combined to create a pseudo 3-D displacement map for the slope, which was subsequently used to interpret the influence of a major fault and the rock mass fabric in promoting different kinematic responses. The data collected demonstrates that an improved understanding of the 3-D kinematics of a large rock slope can be achieved using advanced state-of-the-art monitoring techniques to aid mine design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Underground extraction can be roughly classified into three types, i.e., subcritical, critical, and supercritical extraction, in accordance with the geological conditions in the overburden and the geometry of mined-out areas. In 2016, we proposed an approach based on the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and the probability integral method (PIM) for the cost-effective prediction of 3-D mining-induced displacements (abbreviated as InSAR-PIM). Due to the inherent assumption of critical extraction in the PIM, the InSAR-PIM method performs well in predicting the 3-D displacements caused by critical and/or supercritical extraction, but poorly for subcritical extraction. In this paper, we first propose a generalized PIM (GPIM) by modifying the traditional PIM with a simplified Boltzmann function. We then replace the PIM of the InSAR-PIM with the proposed GPIM to develop an extension of InSAR-PIM (referred as to InSAR-GPIM). The InSAR-GPIM was tested in the Qianyingzi coal mining area, China. The results show that the InSAR-GPIM-predicted horizontal and vertical displacements caused by subcritical, critical, and supercritical extraction agree well with the in situ observations, with average root-mean-square errors of about 0.032 and 0.050 m, respectively. These accuracies represent improvements of 60.9% and 59% when compared with the accuracies predicted by the InSAR-PIM in the horizontal and vertical directions. The results indicate that the InSAR-GPIM is capable of accurately predicting 3-D mining-induced displacements under different extraction conditions (i.e., subcritical, critical, and supercritical extraction), and it performs much better than the InSAR-PIM in the case of subcritical extraction. It is therefore believed that InSAR-GPIM will have a wider scope of applications than the previous InSAR-PIM. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The study of the geomorphological evolution of landscapes is one of the most important tasks needed for assessing the natural and man-made geohazards and risks affecting a territory. In the last two decades, instrumental and computational advances have allowed the development of effective remote sensing methodologies, such as those based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry or change detection techniques (Tomás & Li, 2017). These techniques have enhanced the possibilities of making geomorphic observations and modelling. Specifically, Earth Observations (EO) techniques using airborne or satellite platforms have increased the ability to map and monitor geomorphological processes. In such a framework, historical landscape data, such as those available from aerial photographs taken since the early 1940s, are key instruments for studying the geomorphological evolution of a territory. In this work, the application of the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique to analyse the geomorphological evolution of sample areas by historical aerial photos is tested, examined, and discussed. Towards this aim, multi-temporal analysis by means of three-dimensional (3D) land models of four test areas reconstructed through the application of the SfM technique using available aerial images was performed. Although it is well known that SfM requires a considerable number of digital images and a significant overlap between them, the challenge of this approach was to reconstruct 3D land models using a reduced set of analogical aerial photos for satisfactory results. The resulting 3D reconstructions succeeded in recognizing and studying the geomorphological evolution of the test areas, represented by: a) a region in southern Italy affected by landslides; b) a territory in central Italy affected by badland-type intense erosional phenomena; c) a sector in northwestern Italy with open-pit mining activity; and d) a coastal zone affected by changes in its coastline. Despite some disadvantages that arose during the application of the SfM technique, the proposed methodology has been shown to be useful for geomorphological analysis. This can be considered an alternative to the use of analogical and digital stereoscopic techniques to recognize geomorphological shapes and analyse Earth surface evolution and the effects of different anthropic activities. © Comitato Glaciologico Italiano.

	abstract = {Underground coal mining produces ground subsidence that adversely impacts the environment. Huainan coalfield, one of the largest coalfields in East China, experiences fast ground subsidence that restricts agricultural, urban and rural developments in this region. We used stacking and the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of ground subsidence in Huainan coalfield caused by underground coal mining activities. Fourteen L-band ALOS PALSAR images acquired during 2007–2010 were used to retrieve high-resolution and high-precision time series of ground deformation and the mean deformation rate. The results show that subsidence with a rate of up to 15 cm/year is widely spread over the studied area in response to mining operation. In regions where mining lasted for many years, ground subsidence continues at a steady rate during the entire observation period. In regions of recent (i.e., since 2007–2009) mining activities, ground subsidence is rapidly accelerating. Accumulated subsidence already caused submerging of the agriculture lands, limiting further mining activities and farming. The InSAR results are consistent with the ground leveling measurements and observations. It is confirmed that the L-band InSAR can be successfully utilized for mapping long-term subsidence in Huainan coalfield in China caused by underground coal mining activities. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Discontinuities possess a major role in the stability of a rock slope and also influence the behavior and failure patterns of it under different loading environments. In this paper, the effects of different joint patterns on the stability of a 260-m-high slope with a face angle (ψf) of 55° are examined under different loading environments. Under gravity loading, when the slope is having out-of-plane joints, it becomes more stable when the dip of the discontinuity (ψ) increases, although failure pattern changes. Plane and rotational failure patterns are observed when ψ becomes less than and greater than ψf, respectively. In case of joints dipping into the plane, the shear displacement becomes significantly less than the previous cases, which indicates a toppling failure. Similar observations can be made under rainfall condition and under seismic loading. In the seismic case, shear displacement and block rotations are obtained. The failure mechanisms of the slopes under different joint sets are investigated by obtaining displacements at different time intervals of the seismic loading. Universal distinct element code (UDEC 4.0) is used for all the simulations. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.},

	abstract = {One of the exceptional advantages of spaceborne remote sensors is their regular scanning of the Earth surface, resulting thus in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), extremely useful to monitor natural or man-made phenomena on the ground. In this chapter, after providing a brief overview of the most recent methods proposed to process and/or analyze time series of remotely sensed data, we describe methods handling two issues: the unsupervised exploration of SITS and the reconstruction of multispectral images. In particular, we first present data mining methods for extracting spatiotemporal patterns in an unsupervised way and illustrate this approach on time series of displacement measurements derived from multitemporal InSAR images. Then we present two methods which aim to reconstruct multispectral images contaminated by the presence of clouds. The first one is based on a linear contextual prediction mode that reproduces the local spectro-temporal relationships characterizing a given time series of images. The second method tackles the image reconstruction problem within a compressive sensing formulation and with different implementation strategies. A rich set of illustrations on real and simulated examples is provided and discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

	abstract = {The stability of rock slopes in open pit mines is crucial to the safe and efficient operation of a surface mine. When not planned for, rock slope failures can cause injuries, equipment damage or loss, delayed production schedule, and even loss of economic ore. Slope monitoring has emerged as a viable engineering tool to help mine operators better understand rock slope behaviour and response to mining activities and environmental conditions during the life of the mine. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of slope monitoring technologies with focus on the most recent development of Ground-Based interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR). Discrete slope surface monitoring systems such as laser prism surveys and surface extensometers provide very accurate and precise point measurements. The data obtained from strategically placed discrete monitoring systems is generally sufficient to accurately describe simple, local failures. For large scale, complex failures however, monitoring systems that produce full-face scans such as radar are necessary. For the purpose of providing near real-time slope displacement data, the most suitable method is ground-based radar interferometry. High resolution, combined with large area coverage, thanks to the possibility of installing the radar at long distances from the slope, and short scan time, make GB-SAR one of the most effective slope monitoring technologies available today. In this paper, it is shown that the GB-SAR systemis able to timely detect and provide alarms on large scale slope movements for both gentle and steep slopes, as well as local scale movements at bench-scale which is equally important to the safety of mine operators at the work face. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {In coal mining areas, ground subsidence persistently happens, which produces serious environmental issues and affects the development of cities. To monitor the ground deformation due to coal mining, a modified time-series InSAR technique combining persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs) is presented in this paper. In particular, DSs are efficiently identified using classified information and statistical characteristics. Furthermore, a two-scale network is introduced into traditional PSI to deal with PSs and DSs in a multi-layer framework by taking the advantage of the robust of PSs and the widely distribution of DSs. The proposed method is performed to investigate the subsidence of Huainan City, Anhui province (China), during 2012-2013 using 14 scenes of Radarsat-2 images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can ease the estimation complexity and significantly increase the spatial density of measurement points, which can provide more detailed deformation information. Result shows that there are obvious subsidence areas detected in the test site with subsidence velocity larger than 5 cm/year. The proposed method brings practical applications for non-urban area deformation monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activity related to the extraction of gas and oil, raw materials or water pumping leads to slow or rapid ground deformation. The ground motion rate is related to the type of the mined material, geological conditions, mining methods and other factors. Ground subsidence resulting from the collapse of underground post-mining voids occurs gradually. Mining-induced earthquakes and seismic earthquakes are largely unpredictable and have an adverse impact on the local inhabitants and buildings. For this reason, monitoring of this phenomenon is a challenge. The application of interferometric SAR for the evaluation of ground movement has brought satisfactory results over the past twenty years mainly in the regions where no other measurements were conducted during ground subsidence. In this paper we have examined a mining-induced earthquake with a magnitude 4.5 which occurred in an underground copper ore mine in Poland on 29th November 2016 and caused eight fatalities. It also had an impact on ground surface deformation in the vicinity of the mine tailings. An assessment of the earthquake-related impact on surface movement was carried out by Sentinel-1 TOPS time series interferometry. The velocity of ground movement and the scale of the phenomenon were investigated. In addition, the impact of the mining-induced earthquake on Zelazny Most mine tailings site was analyzed. Moreover, the process of dynamic ground compaction was also investigated in detail. Ground movement following the mine earthquake was explored. Two time phases of the movements were determined. The first phase of dynamic ground displacement was rapid and 90% of total ground deformation appeared on the surface within 7 days. The second phase of displacement was a ‘vanishing’ one; it lasted for approx. 3 weeks and 10% of ground deformation appeared on the surface. The study revealed that the maximum observed ground subsidence did not exceed 9 cm. The presented results contribute to a better understanding of post-earthquake ground deformations in the light of their spatial distribution in time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of large-gradient deformation caused by coal mining is of great significance to the prevention and management of disasters in mining areas. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method captures the small-gradient ground deformation on the edge of the subsidence basin accurately but is unreliable for capturing large-gradient deformation. The intensity-based pixel-tracking method (e.g., the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method) can overcome the limitations of InSAR's maximum detectable displacement gradient and incoherence. However, the pixel-tracking method is sensitive to template size. It is difficult to estimate ground subsidence accurately by the conventional pixel-tracking method with fixed template size. In this paper, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is redefined and an improved locally adaptive template size method is proposed by identifying optimal template adaptively based on maximization of the redefined SNR. The constraint radius is used to constrain the search area in this improved method. The frequency of misrepresentation is reduced by finding the peak of the correlation coefficient surface within the search area. Both simulation data and real ground subsidence data are used to test this algorithm. The results show that this method can improve monitoring accuracy compared with the traditional pixel-tracking method for fixed template size. © 2017 Jilei Huang et al.},

	abstract = {On 17 November 2016, an unexpected slope failure occurred in an undisclosed copper open-pit mine. The nature of the event urged for a thorough back-analysis of slope monitoring data in order to assess its size and temporal evolution, and to determine whether precursors potentially able to anticipate the failure were present. To this aim, satellite InSAR data spanning over the final 9 months before the event were, in retrospect, acquired and coupled with measurements from a ground-based radar that was in use at the time of the failure. Although progressive deformation was detected by the ground-based radar in correspondence of the two uppermost benches in the pit, the satellite InSAR data revealed that the vast majority of the instability actually involved a large part of natural slope above the mine crest. This sector was not visible by the ground-based radar. Thanks to the short revisit time of the Sentinel-1 mission, clear slope accelerating creep was observed for the first time in satellite InSAR measurements over an open-pit mine. The delimitation of the area featuring accelerating creep behavior matched remarkably the source area of the failure as mapped in the field after the event. Considerations on the volume of the instability and on the development of the failure process (both in space and time) were consequently derived. The results provided a clear example of the value of jointly using ground-based and satellite interferometry to reduce the uncertainties inherent to the identification and characterization of impending catastrophic slope failures. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {We used satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) data to document ground deformation across North America suspected to be caused by human activities. We showed that anthropogenic deformation can be measured from space across the continent and thus satellite observations should be collected routinely to characterize this deformation. We included results from the literature as well as new analysis of more than 5000 interferograms from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite, Envisat, the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), and other satellites, collectively spanning the period 1992-2015. This compilation, while not complete in terms of spatial or temporal coverage nor uniform in quality over the region, contains 263 different areas of likely anthropogenic ground deformation, including 65 that were previously unreported. The sources can be attributed to groundwater extraction (50%), geothermal sites (6%), hydrocarbon production (20%), mining (21%), and other sources (3%) such as lake level changes driven by human activities and tunneling. In a few areas, the source of deformation is ambiguous. We found at least 80 global positioning system (GPS) stations within 20 km of of these areas that could be contaminated by the anthropogenic deformation. At sites where we performed a full time series analysis, we found a mix of steady and time-variable deformation rates. For example, at the East Mesa Geothermal Field in California, we found an area that changed from subsidence to uplift around 2006, even though publicly available records of pumping and injection showed no change during that time. We illustrate selected non-detections from wastewater injection in Oklahoma and eastern Texas, where we found that the detection threshold with available data is > 0.5 cm/yr. This places into doubt previous results claiming detection below this threshold in eastern Texas. However, we found likely injection-induced uplift in a different area of eastern Texas at rates in excess of -2 cm/yr. We encourage others to expand the database in space and time in the supplemental material. © 2017 by the author.},

	abstract = {Mapping deformation field time-series, including vertical and horizontal motions, is vital for landslide monitoring and slope safety assessment. However, the conventional differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) technique can only detect the displacement component in the satellite-to-ground direction, i.e., line-of-sight (LOS) direction displacement. To overcome this constraint, a new method was developed to obtain the displacement field time series of a slope by coupling DInSAR based small baseline subset approach (DInSAR-SBAS) with multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI) based small baseline subset approach (MAI-SBAS). This novel method has been applied to a set of 11 observations from the phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) sensor onboard the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS), spanning from 2007 to 2011, of two large-scale north-south slopes of the largest Asian open-pit mine in the Northeast of China. The retrieved displacement time series showed that the proposed method can detect and measure the large displacements that occurred along the north-south direction, and the gradually changing two-dimensional displacement fields. Moreover, we verified this new method by comparing the displacement results to global positioning system (GPS) measurements. © 2015 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The intra-plate deformation of the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) located in Central Europe is investigated using geodetic measurement techniques. We present a new approach to calculate a combined velocity field from InSAR, levelling and GNSS measurements. As the expected tectonic movements in the URG area are small (less than 1 mm a-1), the best possible solutions for linear velocity rates from single-technique analyses are estimated in a first step. Second, we combine the velocity rates obtained from InSAR (line of sight velocity rates in ascending and descending image geometries), levelling (vertical velocity rates) and GNSS (horizontal velocity rates) using least-squares adjustment (LSA). Focusing on the Northern URG area, we analyse SAR data on four different image stacks (ERS ascending, ERS descending, Envisat ascending, Envisat descending) using the Persistent Scatterer (PS) approach. The linear velocity rates in ascending and descending image geometries, respectively, are estimated in an LSA from joint time-series analysis of ERS and Envisat data. Vertical velocity rates from levelling are obtained from a consistent adjustment of more than 40 000 measured height differences using a kinematic displacement model. Horizontal velocity rates in east and north direction are calculated from a time-series analysis of daily coordinate estimates at 76 permanently operating GNSS sites in the URG region. As the locations, at which the measurement data of PS-InSAR, levelling and GNSS reside, do not coincide, spatial interpolation is needed during several steps of the rigorous processing. We use Ordinary Kriging to interpolate from a given set of data points to the locations of interest with a special focus on the modeling and propagation of errors. The final 3-D velocity field is calculated at a 200 m grid, which carries values only close to the location of PS points, resulting in a mean horizontal and vertical precision of 0.30 and 0.13 mm a-1, respectively. The vertical component of the combined velocity field shows a significant subsidence of about 0.5 mm a-1 in the northern part of the graben coinciding with a well-known quaternary basin structure. Horizontal displacement rates of up to 0.8 mm a-1 in southeast direction are observed outside the graben, in reasonable alignment with the average direction of maximum horizontal stress. Within the graben, the velocity directions rotate toward east in the non-subsiding part, while an opposite trend is observed in the subsiding part of the graben. The complexities of the observed velocity field are compatible to the geomechanical situation in our investigation area which is characterized by a transition from a restraining to a releasing bend setting. Glacial isostatic adjustment is another potential source influencing the observed velocity field, as well as anthropogenic signals due to mining, oil exploration and groundwater usage that have been identified in some places. © The Authors 2015.

	abstract = {The potential of long-term, real-time surface displacement monitoring by ground-based radar interferometry (GB-InSAR) to improve the understanding of mechanisms and set up objective early warning criteria for complex rockslides is explored. Monitoring data for a rockslide in the Central Italian Alps, collected since 1997 by ground-based and remote-sensing techniques, are examined. A unique 9-year continuous GB-InSAR monitoring activity supported an objective subdivision of the rockslide into “early warning domains” with homogeneous involved material, mechanisms and sensitivity to rainfall inputs. Distributed GB-InSAR data allowed setting up a “virtual monitoring network” by a posteriori selection of critical locations representative of early warning domains, for which we analysed relationships among rainfall descriptors and displacement rates. The potential of different early warning criteria, depending on the instability mechanisms dominating different domains, is tested. Results show that (a) rainfall intensity-duration-displacement rate relationships can be useful tools to predict displacements of “rainfall-sensitive” rockslide sectors, where clear trigger-response signals occur, but are unsuitable in rockslide domains affected by the long-term progressive failure of the rock slope and (b) effective early warning strategies for collapse scenarios (entire rockslide, specific domains) can be enforced by modelling real-time, high-frequency GB-InSAR data according to the accelerated creep theory. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The article presents an attempt at using synthetic aperture radar interferometry to determine surface displacement in a region affected by a strong earthquake induced by underground mining operations. It was assumed that the satellite radar data obtained from the Sentinel 1A/B satellites may be used to monitor induced seismicity, i.e. mining tremors. Such seismic activity is observed at much shallower depths, and the surface area affected by such activity is much more limited than in the case of natural seismic events. Research was performed in a region located in the southwest part of Poland, where copper ore is extracted using underground methods. The geological structure of the selected area increases the likelihood of induced seismic events. Moreover, the area is one of the most seismically active regions in this part of Europe. The tremor analysed in this paper occurred on November 29, 2016, and had a magnitude of Mw4.2. Calculations showed that the seismic event resulted in the creation of a 2.7 km x 2.5 km subsidence basin. The paper demonstrates that it is possible to use data provided by the Sentinel 1A/B satellites to detect surface displacements caused by a mining tremor. © 2019, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic,.

Today, GBInSAR is used internationally as a leading-edge tool for near-real-time monitoring of surface slope movements in landslides and open pit mines. The success of the technology relies mainly on its ability to measure slope movements rapidly with sub-millimetric accuracy over wide areas and in almost any weather conditions. In recent years, GBInSAR has experienced significant improvements, due to the development of more advanced radar techniques in terms of both data processing and sensor performance. These improvements have led to widespread diffusion of the technology for early warning monitoring of slopes in both civil and mining applications. The main technical features of modern SAR technology for slope monitoring are discussed in this paper. A comparative analysis with other monitoring technologies is also presented along with some recent examples of successful slope monitoring. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {The geodetic measurements optimization problem has played a crucial role in the mining areas affected by continuous ground movement. Such movements are most frequently measured with the classical geodetic methods such as levelling, tachymetry or GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). The measuring techniques are selected with respect to the dynamics of the studied phenomena, surface hazard degree, as well as the financial potential of the mining company. Land surface changes caused by underground exploitation are observed with some delay because of the mining and geological conditions of the deposit surroundings. This delay may be considerable in the case of salt deposits extraction due to slow convergence process, which implies ground subsidence maximum up to a few centimeters per year. Measuring of such displacements requires high precision instruments and methods. In the case of intensely developed urban areas, a high density benchmark network has to be provided. Therefore, the best solution supporting the monitoring of vertical ground displacements in the areas located above the salt deposits seems to be the Sentinel 1-A radar imaging satellite system. The main goal of the investigation was to verify if imaging radar from the Sentinel 1 mission could be applied to monitor of slow ground vertical movement above word heritage Wieliczka salt mine. The outcome of the analysis, which was based on DInSAR (Differential SAR Interferometry). technology, is the surface distribution of annual subsidence in the period of 2015-2016. The comparison of the results with levelling confirmed the high accuracy of satellite observations. What is significant, the studies allowed to identify areas with the greatest dynamics of vertical ground movements, also in the regions where classical surveying was not conducted. The investigation proved that with the use of Sentinel-1 images sub centimeters slow vertical movements could be obtained. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.},

This article presents an approach to determine three-dimensional ground displacements in mining areas with the large gradient or phase decorrelation by integrating multiple interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods. The core of the proposed method is that the offset-tracking method is employed to solve for the displacement with the large gradient or phase decorrelation. First, the displacements in the radar line-of-sight directions are obtained from two interferometric pairs with different viewing geometries by integrating the measurements of differential InSAR and offset tracking. Then, the displacements in the azimuthal directions are obtained from two interferometric pairs with different viewing geometries by integrating the measurements of multiple aperture interferometry and offset tracking. Finally, the three-dimensional ground displacement fields are inferred from these four independent, one-dimensional displacements using the least squares method and Helmert variance component estimation. We apply this method to obtain the three-dimensional ground displacement field in the Dongtan mine region. We compare the results with those of levelling and global positioning system surveys, and the root mean square errors of the results were 24 and 43 mm in the vertical direction and horizontal directions, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be used to estimate three-dimensional ground displacement fields in mining areas with large-gradient displacement and phase decorrelation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It is being known as a very efficient tool for monitoring ground deformation over suburban or non-urban regions with great success. However, research conducted using C-band Envisat-based ATS-InSAR failed to produce reasonable outcome within Appin Colliery primarily due to the underground mining effect, which is located in the southeastern corner of the Southern Coalfield, New South Wales, Australia; thus, the general underground mining pattern cannot be formed. This work presents a modified ATS-InSAR method for mapping the ground deformation over underground mining region. More specifically, in order to achieve the best outcome, a modified measurement scatterer (MS) pixel selection method is introduced by including less reliable MS pixels through an Inverse Distance Weighted-based integration method. In addition, the proposed method is also applied to C-band Sentinel-1 image stacks for testing purpose, and the final result proved to be efficient to offer sufficient information to the mining industry and government for risk management purpose. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {It is difficult to get robust deformation results using conventional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) method, due to the limitation of the phase measurement error, baseline error, and atmospheric delay in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) represents a powerful tool to measure mining subsidence, as it offers a synoptic view that can be repeated at different time intervals and at various scales. In many cases, PSI data are integrated with in situ monitoring instrumentation, since the joint use of satellite and ground-based data facilitates the geological interpretation of mining subsidence and allows a better understanding of mining subsidence geometry and kinematics. In this paper, PSI interferometry and conventional ground-based monitoring techniques have been used to characterize and to monitor Ge-Ting mining located in Shandong, China. The PSI technique used in this paper overcomes most of the limitations of conventional interferometric approaches by identifying, within the area of interest, a set of 'radar benchmarks' (PS), where very precise displacement measurements can be carried out. More than 78000 PS were identified by processing SAR images acquired from 2004 to 2009 by the ENVISAT. The PSInSAR application at a sub-regional scale detected slow ground deformations ranging from 0 to -58 cm/year and resulting from various processes (swelling/shrinkage of clay soils and water pumping). The results reveal the evolution process of 'bowl' in mining subsidence and are helpful to the early warning of the mine disaster. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Yuyang mine is located in the semiarid western region of China where, due to serious land subsidence caused by underground coal exploitation, the local ecological environment has become more fragile. An advanced interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, temporarily coherent point InSAR, is applied to measure surface movements caused by different mining conditions. Fifteen high-resolution TerraSAR-X images acquired between October 2, 2012, and March 27, 2013, were processed to generate time-series data for ground deformation. The results show that the maximum accumulated values of subsidence and velocity were 86 mm and 162mm/year, respectively; these measurements were taken above the fully mechanized longwall caving faces. Based on the dynamic land subsidence caused by the exploitation of one working face, the land subsidence range was deduced to have increased 38 m in the mining direction with 11 days' coal extraction. Although some mining faces were ceased in 2009, they could also have contributed to a small residual deformation of overlying strata. Surface subsidence of the backfill mining region was quite small, the maximum only 21 mm, so backfill exploitation is an effective method for reducing the land subsidence while coal is mined. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

	abstract = {High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas are crucial to assess mining-related geohazards and understand the mining deformation mechanism. In 2018, we proposed a cost-effective and robust method for retrieving mining-induced 3-D displacements from a single SAR amplitude pair (SAP) using offset tracking (OT) procedures. Hereafter, we refer to this method as the 'alternative OT-SAP' (AOT-SAP) method. A key step in the AOT-SAP method is solving the 3-D surface displacements from the AOT-SAP-constructed linear system using routine lower-upper (LU) factorization. However, if the AOT-SAP method is used to retrieve high-resolution 3-D displacements, the dimension of the linear system becomes very large (in the order millions), and a high-end supercomputer is often needed to perform the LU-based solving procedure. This significantly narrows the practical application of the AOT-SAP method, considering the limited availability of supercomputers. In this paper, owing to the banded nature of the AOT-SAP-constructed linear system, we introduce the SPIKE algorithm as an alternative to LU factorization to solve high-resolution mining-induced 3-D displacements. The SPIKE algorithm is a divide-and-conquer direct solver of a large banded system, which can parallelly or sequentially solve a large banded linear system, with a much smaller memory requirement and a shorter time cost than LU factorization. This allows us to retrieve the high-resolution 3-D mining-induced displacements with the AOT-SAP method on either a supercomputer or a standard personal computer. Finally, the accuracy of the retrieved 3-D displacements and the efficiency improvement of the SPIKE algorithm were tested using both simulation analysis and a real dataset. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The main objective of the present study was to investigate land subsidence phenomena and prepare a land subsidence map using spatio-temporal analysis of groundwater resources, remote sensing techniques and data mining methods. The methodology was implemented at the wider plain area extending northwest of Farsala town, Thessaly, Greece, covering an area of approximately 145 Km2. In order to estimate the spatio-temporal trend concerning groundwater level the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s Slope estimator were applied, whereas a set of Synthetic Aperture Radar images, processed with the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry technique, were evaluated in order to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of ground deformation. In a test site where ground deformation rate values derived by the analysis of SAR images, Support Vector Machines was utilized to predict the subsidence deformation rate based on three variables, namely: thickness of loose deposits, the Sen’s Slope value of groundwater trend and the Compression Index of the formation covering the area of research. Based on the Support Vector Machine model, a land subsidence map was then produced for the entire research area. The outcomes of the study indicated a strong relation between the thickness of the loose deposits and the deformation subsidence rate and a clear trend between the subsidence deformation rate and the groundwater fluctuation. The r square value for the validation dataset within the test site was estimated to be 0.75. The land subsidence map produced by the Support Vector Machine model was validated by field surveys and measurements and showed good predictive performance. In conclusion, the subsidence model proposed in this study allows the accurate identification of surface deformations and can be helpful for the local authorities and government agencies to take measures before the evolution of severe subsidence phenomena and therefore for timely protection of the affected areas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Subsidence related to multiple natural and human-induced processes affects an increasing number of areas worldwide. Although this phenomenon may involve surface deformation with 3D displacement components, negative vertical movement, either progressive or episodic, tends to dominate. Over the last decades, differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) has become a very useful remote sensing tool for accurately measuring the spatial and temporal evolution of surface displacements over broad areas. This work discusses the main advantages and limitations of addressing active subsidence phenomena by means of DInSAR techniques from an end-user point of view. Special attention is paid to the spatial and temporal resolution, the precision of the measurements, and the usefulness of the data. The presented analysis is focused on DInSAR results exploitation of various ground subsidence phenomena (groundwater withdrawal, soil compaction, mining subsidence, evaporite dissolution subsidence, and volcanic deformation) with different displacement patterns in a selection of subsidence areas in Spain. Finally, a cost comparative study is performed for the different techniques applied. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Most plains in Iran are subject to land subsidence due to over-exploitation of groundwater mainly for agricultural purposes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry has shown its ability to provide precise measurements of the ground surface displacement at high spatial and temporal resolution. In SAR interferometry, the processed interferograms are combined together via interferogram stacking or time series analysis. Stacking is a temporal averaging of the interferograms which results in mean displacement velocity. However, time series analysis of a significant number of interferograms enables us to study the short-term as well as ling-term behavior of the subsidence. In this research, three different case studies were accomplished for subsidence monitoring. The subsidence in the Varamin plain was studied using 13 ENVISAR ASAR images spanning between 2003/08/03 and 2005/11/20. The maximum subsidence rate extracted from Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) time series was estimated as 0.4 m/year. The second case study was to monitor the subsidence in the Neyshabour plain. In this area, the interferogram stacking using 9 ENVISAT ASAR images spanning between 2004/01/10 and 2005/06/18 was applied. The maximum subsidence rate was estimated as 0.16 m/year. Groundwater level measurements made at piezometric wells were applied to compare to the interferometry results. The piezometric wells mostly show the increase in water level depth caused by over-exploitation of groundwater. The groundwater information jointly with stratigraphic profiles highly correlate with subsidence in the area. In the last case study, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) which is a proper method of time series analysis in areas with high decorrelation effects, was used in the Shahriar plain. A hybrid method of conventional and PSI was proposed in order to address the problem of monitoring the high-rate deformation. There are 22 ENVISAT ASAR images available in the study area spanning between 2003 and 2008. The maximum subsidence rate was estimated as 0.25 m/year. The time series analysis results were then compared to the groundwater level information at piezometric wells. Due to the low correlation between water level decline and subsidence rate at some piezometric wells, it can be concluded that other geology and hydrogeological factors play important role in controlling the subsidence occurrence. To show this, two data mining methods including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network as well as Support Vector Regression (SVR) were applied to model the subsidence in Shahriar plain using 6 different geology and hydrogeology factors as input and the subsidence rate extracted from interferometry as output of the model. These models can be further applied to estimate the subsidence rate in pixels in which the interferometry technique cannot measure the deformation due to some reasons including insufficient correlation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

This site corresponds to the location of an industrial exploitation of underground salt using the solution mining technique. An area of subsidence has been observed using in situ measurements. Despite conditions unfavorable for InSAR because of the vegetal cover, we show that radar remote sensing observations provide valuable information which substantially improves our knowledge of the phenomenon. An adaptive phase filtering process has been used to improve the coherence level. In particular, our study shows that the geometry of the subsidence bowl is different to that previously assumed using ground-based techniques only. The size of the subsidence bowl (8 km) is larger than expected. This information will be useful for further modeling of the deformation and to improve the coverage of the in situ measurement networks. It also shows that radar interferometry can be used for the long-term monitoring of such sites and to predict potential environmental issues. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

With the use of 13 PALSAR scenes over the mining area in Henan province, the authors succeed to extract the subsidence rates on all PS targets. The results show that the averaged subsidence rates in the area is 0.5 cm/yr while the mining areas have a velocity of up to 3 cm/yr. The displacement is accordant very well with that of leveling.

	abstract = {This article presents the main results of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Codes Cross Comparison and Certification for long term differential interferometry (PSIC4) project. The project was based on the validation of the PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) data with respect to levelling data on a subsiding mining area near Gardanne, in the South of France. Eight PSI participant teams processed the SAR data without any a priori information, as a blind test. Intercomparison of the different teams' results was then carried out in order to assess any similarities and discrepancies. The subsidence velocity intercomparison results obtained from the PSI data showed a standard deviation between 0.6 and 1.9 mm/year between the teams. The velocity validation against rates measured on the ground showed a standard deviation between 5 and 7 mm/year. A comparison of the PSI time series and levelling time series shows that if the displacement is larger than about 2 cm in between two consecutive SAR-images, PS-InSAR starts to seriously deviate from the levelling time series. Non-linear deformation rates up to several cm/year appear to be the main reason for these reduced performances, as no prior information was used to adjust the processing parameters. Under such testing conditions and without good ground-truth information, the phase-unwrapping errors for this type of work are a major issue. This point illustrates the importance of having ground truth information and a strong interaction with the end-user of the data, in order to properly understand the type and speed of the deformation that is to be measured, and thus determine the applicability of the technique. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The application of conventional SAR Interferometry (InSAR) together with the two techniques of sub-centimeter accuracy, the Stacking and the Permanent Scatterers (PS) Interferometry, were used to study the ground deformation in the broader area of Athens for the period 1992 to 2002. Using the Stacking interferometric method, 55 ERS-1&2 SAR scenes, between 1992 and 2002, were acquired producing 264 differential interferograms. Among these only 60 were finally selected as fulfilling certain criteria. The co-seismic deformation associated with the Athens Earthquake (Mw = 5.9, September 7, 1999) was excluded from the analytical procedure in an attempt to present results of only aseismic character. In total ground subsidence results of about 12 mm in the southern suburbs of Athens, but higher value of about 40 mm in the northern ones for the period 1992-2002. Based on the PS technique, a precise average annual deformation rate-map was generated for the period 1992-1999, ending just before the Athens earthquake event. Both circular and elongated-shape areas of subsidence are recognizable especially in the northern part of the Athens Basin (3-4 mm/yr), as well as at its southern part (1-3 mm/yr). In addition, a rate of 2-3 mm/yr is also yielded for some part of the Athens city center. Subsidence rates of 1-2 mm/yr are measured at the western part of the basin over an area of old mining activities, and around the newly built Syntagma Metro Station. The correlation of the observed deformation patterns with respect to the spatial distribution of water pumping, older mining activities, metro line tunneling and other local geological parameters is examined and discussed.

	abstract = {Fushun is a famous coal-mining city in northeastern China with more than 100 years of history. Long-term underground coal mining has caused serious surface subsidence in the eastern part of the city. In this study, multitemporal and multi-source satellite remote sensing data were used to detect subsidence and geomorphological changes associated with underground coal mining over a 10-year period (1996-2006). A digital elevation model (DEM) was generated through Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry processing using data from a pair of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) SAR images acquired in 1996. In addition, a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM obtained from data in 2000 and an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEM from 2006 were used for this study. The multitemporal DEMs indicated that the maximum vertical displacement due to subsidence was around 13 m from 1996 to 2006. Multitemporal ASTER images showed that the flooded water area associated with subsidence had increased by 1.73 km2 over the same time period. Field investigations and ground level measurements confirmed that the results obtained from the multitemporal remote sensing data agreed well with ground truth data. This study demonstrates that DEMs derived from multisource satellite remote sensing data can provide a powerful tool to map geomorphological changes associated with underground mining activities. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

Using SAR intensity images, this paper employs the image offset tracking method to map SAR slant range changes due to ground deformation over areas of mining. The rationale of slant range offset measurement with respect to the vertical deformation is analysed and the prerequisite of applying the slant range offset method to monitor vertical deformation is discussed. Results from the slant range offset method are used to produce time-series of cumulative ground displacements via least square estimate. We use six Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) images over two coalfields in Inner Mogolia, China, to illustrate the proposed method and its effectiveness.We achieve deformation measurements with a precision of ∼0.2 m, with the maximum vertical displacement over the mining sites reaching ∼4.5 m. Finally, we use time-series results to outline common features identified in mining-induced deformation. Our results are supported by in situ investigations. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Block caving often leads to significant ground deformations that if not properly assessed and accounted for may threaten the integrity and safety of overlying mine infrastructure. To mitigate this risk, sophisticated 3-D numerical modelling has been turned to as a means of predicting the extent and magnitudes of caving-induced surface subsidence. However, the complexity of the rock mass interactions involved, coupled with the uncertainty associated with geological heterogeneity, rock mass properties and in-situ stresses results in the need for models to be constrained and calibrated. Results are first presented here from a detailed 3-D back analysis of a caving-induced open pit mine slope failure, used to constrain the rock mass properties and far-field in-situ stresses derived from field characterisation data, as well as to bring understanding to the problem with respect to the cave-pit interactions. The "best fit" set of input properties obtained was then used for forward modelling of caving-induced subsidence for the period 2009-2010. Further calibration of this model was performed using high-resolution InSAR monitoring data. The close fit achieved between the predictive 3-D numerical model and InSAR data demonstrates the promise of InSAR as a means to calibrate sophisticated numerical models, and thereby contribute to managing block caving associated subsidence hazards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The VFRS shall be a mobile, robust, real-time, easy to use early warning system, which, in case of a volcanic crisis, will support the locale authorities in their decisions about hazard mitigation provisions, especially about the evacuation of people. The hybrid deformation observation system combines a ground-based Synthetic Aperture Radar named IBIS-L with a network of GPS receivers and will allow the continuous, weather independent determination of areal 3D displacements. In this paper we present the results of first tests with IBIS-L in an active quarry near Dieburg, Germany. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was determined with IBIS-L and compared with a DEM derived by terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetry. The ability to determine accurate DEMs with IBIS-L is the basis for the combination of different observation techniques, as without a DEM the displacements observed with IBIS-L cannot be georeferenced. The standard deviation of the differences between the DEM by IBIS-L and the DEM by laser scanning and photogrammetry depends on the surface characteristics. We found a standard deviation of 0.8 m at a slope of rocks and debris, 2.0 m at mining terraces with low vegetation and 3.0 m in a vegetation covered area. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has been applied to detect and measure ground deformation in a stretch of the Ebro River valley (Spain) excavated in salt-bearing evaporites. The capability of the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) DInSAR technique to detect ground displacement is analyzed comparing the DInSAR results with the available geomorphological information. The deformation map derived from 27 European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite images covering more than five years provides sub-centimeter displacement measurements in zones coinciding with known active sinkholes and landslides. Moreover the map provides the first account of mining subsidence in the area. The measured deformation rates reach 1·68 cm/y for the sinkholes, 0·80 cm/y for the landslides and 1·45 cm/y for the area affected by mining subsidence. The SBAS DInSAR technique provided deformation measurements in a small proportion (5-10%) of the known active sinkholes and landslides. This limitation is mainly due to the lack of coherence in agricultural areas, the spatial resolution of the deformation map (pixel size of 90 m), and the parallelism between the ERS satellite line of sight and the linear escarpment on which most of the landslides occur. Despite this, the interferometric technique provides valuable data that complement traditional geomorphological studies including the quantification of the deformation phenomena, the identification of mining subsidence otherwise only recognizable by geodetic methods, and the detection of creep deformation which might correspond to premonitory indicators of catastrophic sinkholes and landslides capable of causing the loss of lives. Detailed DInSAR studies combined with field data would be required to improve the analysis of each deformation area. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A major concern involving any steep embankment is its stability. This is the case whether it is the side wall of an open pit mine, a steep slope next to a highway, or a man made structure like a dam or dike used to contain tailings or generate hydroelectric power. In general, for each case there is a slow movement of the formation before a failure actually occurs. With the continuous monitoring of a phenomenon's creep, particularly its acceleration, critical displacements can be detected before the object reaches its failure point. Among new technological developments, robotic total stations (RTSs) give one possible cost effective solution to creating a near real time monitoring system. Repeated surveys at predetermined time intervals can automatically generate warnings if slope movements exceed a preset tolerance level. In addition, the system can be augmented with GPS or geotechnical sensors to make it a more reliable system. The strengths of each sensor type can be exploited to optimize the cost and efficiency of the monitoring system to ensure pre-failure detection. The latest monitoring techniques apply the principles of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), using both satellite and portable ground based systems, to determine complete surface deformations rather than the few discrete points that are obtained with the current systems. A methodology has been developed at the Canadian Centre for Geodetic Engineering (CCGE), in cooperation with ACA Ltd, for optimizing the design of monitoring systems by combining geometrical and deterministic modeling methods to ensure proper sensors are installed at proper locations and utilized correctly. The methodology has been realized in the creation of a software package that has been successfully implemented at large earthen dams and open pit mining operations around the world.},

In turn, this has led to many new insights into geophysical and engineering processes, such as volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides and mining activity. In this study, we used an advanced InSAR time series technique to map ground motion of an area in Northern Tibet using ENVISAT images acquired between 2003 and 2007. In order to minimise the effects of baseline decorrelation, a subset of possible pairs having a perpendicular baseline (i.e. orbital separation) of less than 400 m was chosen for the InSAR time series analysis. The time series results reveal an ‘unexpected’ nonlinear ground motion: the area of interest was relatively stable during the period from 2003 to the middle of 2004, whilst it has exhibited a nearly linear uplift of about 8 cm since the middle of 2004. Examination of high-resolution ALOS PRISM images shows that the uplift signal occurred over the Huatugou oil field and is most likely caused by water injection. This study highlights the potential of In-SAR as an early detection tool of surface deformations. © 2009, de Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Kinematic analysis of slope instabilities in brittle rock is crucial for understanding the reaction of the rock mass to external forcing factors. In steep terrain, inaccessibility often limits collection of relevant data and remote sensing techniques must be applied. This is the case at the current Randa rock slope instability in southern Switzerland, where a total volume of about 5-6million m3 moves at a rate of up to 30mm/yr. A large portion of the unstable rock mass is exposed in an 800m high inaccessible cliff; the main scarp of the May 1991 rock slope failure. Between 2005 and 2007, a comprehensive suite of remote sensing techniques, including photogrammetry, LiDAR, and GB-DInSAR, was combined with 3D geodetic measurements to characterize the rock mass structure and displacement patterns. Photogrammetry and LiDAR data were measured simultaneously from a helicopter using a system allowing for oblique view angles, which provided optimal observations of the steep rock cliff. We used these datasets to map large-scale structures and extract their orientation and minimum persistence, as well as to characterize the 1991 failure scarp. The northern part of the May 1991 failure surface shows a transition from stepped planar sliding at the base, to failed rock bridges in the center, to tensile failure close to the vertical head scarp. Kinematic analysis of the discontinuity sets in the currently moving rock mass shows that both toppling and translational sliding are feasible failure mechanisms. Toppling is more likely for steep faces above 2200m, whereas translational failure is more likely in the lower portion of the instability. Interpretation of GB-DInSAR displacement maps revealed similar kinematic behavior, and also allowed identification of a basal rupture zone and lateral release plane bounding the instability. Displacement vectors derived from geodetic surveying provided new insights into the 3D kinematic behavior of the instability. All information extracted from different data sets were integrated in a conceptual model, which was then investigated with 2D numerical simulation using the discontinuum code UDEC. The numerical models were able to reproduce the hypothesized kinematic behavior well. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the formulation of the basic mechanics governing the changes in stress states from groundwater pumping and comparisons among predicted land subsidence from this mechanics with existing analyses and field data. Land subsidence is a growing, global problem caused by petroleum and groundwater withdrawal, mining operations, natural settlement, hydro-compaction, settlement of collapsible soils, settlement of organic soils and sinkholes. This paper is concerned with the land subsidence due to groundwater level decline by groundwater pumping. It is shown that the stress state consists of asymmetric stresses that are best simulated by a Cosserat rather than a Cauchy continuum. Land subsidence from groundwater level decline consists of vertical compression (consolidation), shear displacement and macro-rotation. The latter occurs when conditions are favorable (e.g. at a vertical interface) for the micro-rotation imposed by asymmetric stresses to become macro-rotation. When the length of the cone of depression is beyond √2 times the thickness of the aquifer, simple shear on vertical planes with rotation is the predominant deformation mode. Otherwise, simple shear on horizontal planes is present. The predicted subsidence using the mechanics developed in this paper compares well with data from satellite-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The quantification of land surface displacement through conventional field surveys is based on sparingly distributed point data, which may be insufficient for many applications. A detailed spatial and temporal monitoring of land surface displacements through remote sensing-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry may be valuable. Over the last two decades, differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) has been effectively used globally for the estimation of spatial land surface displacements caused due to natural and man-made hazards. However, it has not gained momentum in India, where occurrences of natural and man-made hazards are a common phenomenon. In this article, preliminary results from DInSAR to measure land surface displacement in Jharia coal fields have been presented. DInSAR results effectively identified the land surface displacement due to several mining activities in the region during a one-month period. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Coal fires have been found to be a serious problem worldwide in coal mining reserves. Coal fires burn valuable coal reserves and lead to severe environmental degradation of the region. Moreover, coal fires can result in massive surface displacements due to the reduction in volume of the burning coal and can cause thermal effects in the adjacent rock mass particularly cracks and fissures. The Wuda coalfield in Northern China is known for being an exclusive storehouse of prime coking coal as well as for being the site of occurrence of the maximum number of known coal fires among all the coalfields in China and worldwide, and is chosen as our study area. In this study, we have investigated the capabilities and limitations of ALOS PALSAR data for monitoring the land subsidence that accompanies coal fires by means of satellite differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) observations. An approach to map the large and highly non-linear subsidence based on a small number of SAR images was applied to the Wuda coalfield to reveal the spatial and temporal signals of land subsidence in areas affected by coal fires. The DInSAR results agree well with coal fire data obtained from field investigations and thermal anomaly information, which demonstrates that the capability of ALOS PALSAR data and the proposed approach have remarkable potential to detect this land subsidence of interest. In addition, our results also provide a spatial extent and temporal evolution of the land subsidence behavior accompanying the coal fires, which indicated that several coal fire zones suffer accelerated ongoing land subsidence, whilst other coal fire zones are newly subsiding areas arising from coal fires in the period of development. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The coal reserves of Limburg, The Netherlands, have been exploited until the mid-1970's, leading to significant land subsidence, a large part of which was due to ground water pumping associated with the mining activities. In 1994, when also the hydrologically-connected neighboring German mining activities ceased, all pumps were finally dismantled. This resulted in rising groundwater levels in the mining areas, continuing until today. Here we report the detection and analysis of heterogeneous surface displacements in the area using satellite radar interferometry. The lack of adequate terrestrial geodetic measurements emphasizes the value of such satellite observations, especially in terms of the temporal and spatial characterization of the signal. Since the lack of direct mine water level measurements hampers predictions on future consequences at the surface, we study the relationship between surface deformation and sub-surface water levels in an attempt to provide rough correlation estimates and map the mine water dynamics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the capability of determining the three dimensional (3D) ground displacements due to underground mining using the multiple ALOS PALSAR interferometric pairs acquired with different viewing geometries has been investigated and validated in the area of West Cliff colliery, New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Four ALOS PALSAR interferometric pairs acquired with two different incidence angles from both ascending and descending orbits were used in this study. Three different approaches were used to derive the 3D displacement maps. The first two approaches utilised SAR data only, while the third approach required a one dimensional measurement by using other surveying techniques as inputs. The results were compared with the GPS field survey data obtained between April and May 2008. The obtained results and the GPS data agreed well with each other in the vertical and the east-west directions. However, the precision of displacement measured in the north-south direction was much poorer for the first two approaches compared to the third approach. This was due to two reasons: (1) the lack of viewing geometries, and (2) the poor temporal overlap in the interferometric combination datasets. The results suggested that it is possible to use other one dimensional surveying techniques to assist the InSAR measurements in order to enhance the accuracy of the 3D deformation derived. The horizontal movements in transverse and longitudinal directions were calculated from the 3D deformation results, in order to derive the subsidence parameters that have been caused by mining activities. The subsidence parameters derived matched well with the GPS-derived parameters. The results suggested that an accurate 3D displacement vectors can be derived by combining InSAR-measurement with measurement from other equipment such as extensometer and optical fibre which may carry out measurement in one direction only (ideally north-south direction). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Few studies of rockslides have addressed the relationships between structures, geomorphological expression and direct evidence for movement. We employ structural geology, geomorphology and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to investigate the evolution of the surface features developed in response to movement of the Gamanjunni rockslide site in Troms County in northern Norway. The slide is located on a west-facing mountainside, and is bounded by two angled back scarps and a 20°-30° basal sliding plane. The volume is estimated at 24 Mm 3 and is therefore among the largest potential rockslides in Norway. InSAR provides a new method to measure the movement of potential rockslides, and thus provides a direct link between qualitative movement data and field observations. We document the relationship between variations in ground movement rates and changing back-scarp geomorphology at the Gamanjunni site as well as movement patterns within the incipient rockslide. We demonstrate that variations in InSAR documents millimetre variations in scarp displacement and that this is reflected in the evolving back-scarp geometry. We conclude that InSAR can provide important information to complement field observations. The ability of InSAR to document landslide movement patterns greatly extends our knowledge of back-scarp evolution and active landslide processes. © The Geological Society of London 2011.},

	abstract = {D-InSAR is currently one of the most popular research tools in the field of Microwave Remote Sensing. It is unrivaled in its aspect of measuring ground deformation due to its advantages such as high resolution, continuous spatial-coverage and dynamics. However, there are still a few major problems to be solved urgently as a result of the intrinsic complexity of this technique. One of the problems deals with improving the accuracy of measured ground deformation. In this paper, various factors affecting the accuracy of ground deformation measured by D-InSAR are systematically analyzed and investigated by means of the law of measurement error propagation. At the same time, we prove that the ground deformation error not only depends on the errors of perpendicular baselines as well as the errors of the interferometric phase for topographic pair and differential pair, but also on the combination of the relationship of perpendicular baselines for topographic pairs and differential pairs. Furthermore, a feasible approach for improving the accuracy of measured ground deformation is proposed, which is of positive significance in the practical application of D-InSAR. © 2007 The Journal of China University of Mining & Technology.},

	abstract = {The recent development of remote sensing techniques brings new possibilities of precise ground movement measurements. One of these possibilities is the PS-InSAR™ method. It allows detecting small and long period ground deformations on large areas. In particular, the PS-InSAR technique involves interferometric phase comparison of several radar images of the same scene taken at different times along the same orbit by satellite radar sensors. The ground deformations occurring in the Campania Region has been recently investigated by applying this interferometric technique in a peculiar project developed by Italian Ministry of Environment. The outcome consists in a very large and complex database that cannot be easily analysed with traditional tools. In order to improve the interpretability of this dataset and to support the study of the geologists of this project, we apply a clustering data mining approach on a sample area and identify homogeneous clusters of ground deformation velocity trends. We report in this paper the main results of this analysis, showing how the chosen clustering method allows a coherent geological interpretation of this large and scattered dataset. © 2011 Asian Network for scientific information.},

Both ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were used in this study. The quality of the 3D deformation mapping results due to underground mining is mainly limited by two factors. (1) Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is less sensitive to displacement along the north-south direction in the case of the current SAR satellite configurations. (2) The mining-induced displacement is continuous and nonlinear; and the accuracy of the 3D DInSAR measurement is severely affected by the similar but non-identical temporal overlaps of the InSAR pairs. The simulation and real data analyzes have shown that it would be more practical to use DInSAR pairs with the assumption of negligible northing displacement to derive the displacements in the easting and vertical directions. The northing displacement could then be estimated from the residuals. This limitation could be overcome in the future with the launch of more radar satellites, which would provide better viewing geometry. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

The structure response was separated into ground vibration and airblast induced movement due to the differences in their times of arrival.This signal was then compared to the sounds recorded to determine which component of blast (ground vibration or airblast) induced the maximum sound. Findings shows that blasts at distances less than 762 meters (2,500 feet) had maximum sound responses from both ground vibration and airblast. While for blasts beyond this distance the maximum sound response was caused by ground vibration without exception. The kitchen generally created the most sound. The second phase of the study was to gauge the public's response or preference to technical information. Three hundred and forty eight (348) telephone surveys were conducted in Logan and Boone counties West Virginia. Based on the survey, the public prefers units of pounds per square inch (psi) for airblast and millimeters of displacement for ground vibration. Ultimately a public relations plan was developed based on the results.},

The methods for extracting displacement information from the amplitude (texture tracking) or from the phase (multitemporal interfemmetry) have been expanded and tested on glacier large displacements or small interseismic deformations. An original data mining approach has also been developedfor extractingfrequentsequentialpatterns and successfully applied to the detection of patterns related to the ground deformation hidden by atmospheric artifacts. Finally a new approach to represent uncertainty by the possibility theory was introduced in the inversion step that can reconstruct 3D displacement fields (East, North, Up) or estimate the model parameters of geophysical phenomena at the origin of the observed surface displacements. These studies thus illustrate the major stages of processing chains from SAR data acquisition to geophysical modeling. © 2011 Lavoisier, Paris.},

	abstract = {Rockslides have a high socioeconomic and environmental importance in many countries. Norway is particularly susceptible to large rockslides due to its many fjords and steep mountains. One of the most dangerous hazards related with rock slope failures are tsunamis that can lead to large loss of life. It is therefore very important to systematically identify potential unstable rock slopes. Traditional landslide monitoring techniques are expensive and time consuming. Differential satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an invaluable tool for land displacement monitoring. Improved access to time series of satellite data has led to the development of several innovative multitemporal algorithms. Small baseline (SB) methods are based on combining and inverting a set of unwrapped interferograms that are computed with a small perpendicular baseline in order to reduce spatial phase decorrelation. Another well proven technique is the persistent scatterer interferometric method (PSI) that is based on analysis of persistent point targets. In this paper, we apply both approaches to study several rockslide sites in Troms County in the far north of Norway. Moreover, we take the opportunity to address the difference and similarities between the SB and the PSI multitemporal InSAR methods for displacement studies in rural terrain. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Those deformations show low amplitude with a maximum rate of more than 1 cm/year during a period of 5 to 7 years after the end of the mining exploitation (1992-1999). Then decrease up to stability, prevails, depending on the area. The deformation field obtained by differential and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry shows good agreement with the traditional methods of levelling comparison focused on specific sites. The recent displacements, revealed by DInSAR and PSI within a wider area, lead us to propose various natural (geology and neotectonics) or/and anthropic origins. © 2009.},

	abstract = {This study presents the application of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm and GIS for subsidence analysis in a mining area located at Gangwon-do, Korea. Several mining areas at the Samchuk coalfield had operating coalmines until 2002-2003. Ground deformation has occurred as a form of subsidence due to the continuous mining activity or the collapse of residual cavities. Twenty-three scenes from a JERS-1 satellite acquired from 1992 to 1998 are used to detect the ground movement by means of the differential InSAR process. Distinctive phase variations induced by subsidence were observed in several interferograms. The SBAS algorithm was applied for a detailed analysis. As a result, it was confirmed that deformation was occurring between September 21, 1992 and September 30, 1998 and attained 22 cm at the most significantly subsiding site. The mean and standard deviation of RMS error were 2.0 cm and 0.78 cm, respectively, showing the level of the error due to the used digital elevation model, unwrapping and atmospheric effect. The SBAS-derived cumulative subsidence map was validated with the underground workings and geological maps in order to find the spatial relations and subsiding mechanism. From the spatial comparison with these data, it was shown that the subsidence has taken place above excavations and fault lines. © 2008 The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the results from the recently launched SAR satellites for the purpose of subsidence monitoring over underground coal mine sites in the state of New South Wales, Australia, using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technique. The quality of the mine subsidence monitoring results is mainly constrained by noise due to the spatial and temporal decorrelation between the interferometric pair and the phase discontinuities in the interferogram. This paper reports on the analysis of the impact of these two factors on the performance of DInSAR for monitoring ground deformation. Simulations were carried out prior to real data analyses. SAR data acquired using different operating frequencies, for example, X-, C- and L-band, from the TerraSAR-X, ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, JERS-1 and ALOS satellite missions, were examined. The simulation results showed that the new satellites ALOS, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed perform much better than the satellites launched before 2006. ALOS and ENVISAT satellite SAR images with similar temporal coverage were searched for the test site. The ALOS PALSAR DInSAR results have been compared to DInSAR results obtained from ENVISAT ASAR data to investigate the performance of both satellites for ground subsidence monitoring. Strong phase discontinuities and decorrelation have been observed in almost all ENVISAT interferograms and hence it is not possible to generate the displacement maps without errors. However these problems are minimal in ALOS PALSAR interferograms due to its spatial resolution and longer wavelength. Hence ALOS PALSAR is preferred for ground subsidence monitoring in areas covered by vegetation and where there is a high rate ground deformation. Copyright © The Society of Geomagnetism and Earth.},

	abstract = {The largest crystalline mass movement in the Alps, the Holocene Köfels rockslide (Tyrol, Austria), was re-investigated in order to study the influence of lithologies and geological structures on deep seated gravitational slope deformations. The slide debris detached from an east-facing slope and left a giant niche, where the geological and morphological conditions point to different types of failure mechanisms. According to the lithologies encountered in the scarp and accumulation area, the main source of the rapid Köfels rockslide is represented by a several hundred metres thick orthogneiss complex embedded in paragneisses of the Austroalpine Ötztal basement unit. Layering and foliation of both the orthogneisses and the surrounding paragneisses are orientated unfavourable to promote slope failures. Rather this slope collapse was clearly structurally predisposed by fault-related valley-deepening and the coalescence of different brittle fracture systems. The key-discontinuities that reduced here the rock mass strength and enabled the failure are two main fracture sets: in the orthogneisses, fracture set og#1 comprises the well-known 25-35° E-dipping sliding planes that daylight subparallel to the slope, set og#2 forms a cluster of 60-80° E- to NE-dipping fractures. In the paragneisses, the fractures measured show a similar but more scattering spatial distribution. Concerning the slope collapse, the newly compiled geological map indicates that the size of the southern scarp area, which is entirely made up by paragneiss series, obviously differs from the volume of according lithologies in the accumulation area. Based on these findings and the scarp morphology, considerable parts of the scarp niche, i.e. areas made up by incompetent paragneisses, were not involved in the rapid Köfels rockslide event but characterised by slowly creeping slope deformations. Furthermore the geological field surveys and remote sensing data, i.e. optical, laserscanner and InSAR images, show that the present-day head scarp is widely affected by post-failure slope deformations. As a major feature, en-echelon orientated steeply E-dipping fractures highly influence the rock mass anisotropy, reduce the strength of the orthogneisses and cause further slope instabilities. Also in the adjacent paragneisses, distinct double-crested ridges, several secondary scarps and extension zones are signs of ongoing rocksliding. As a whole, the Köfels site is an outstanding example of how deep-seated rock slope failures and their potential evolution are controlled by the lithological inventory and the structural setting.},

Unlike interferometric measurement of wide-field deformation, atmospheric propagation heterogeneity is not an accuracy-limiting factor. Although the radar data confirm prior knowledge concerning the landslide, such an application of SAR interferometry appears difficult under normal conditions of observation using current spaceborne radar systems. The study of soil subsidence, however, can be generalized and improves prior knowledge of the displacement field, which has here been modeled assuming elastic deformation in a half-space from several sources. The two examples help to understand the limits of the interferometric technique. Copyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides an all-weather imaging capability for measuring ground-surface deformation and inferring changes in land surface characteristics. InSAR enables scientists to monitor and characterize hazards posed by volcanic, seismic, and hydrogeologic processes, by landslides and wildfires, and by human activities such as mining and fluid extraction or injection. Measuring how a volcano's surface deforms before, during, and after eruptions provides essential information about magma dynamics and a basis for mitigating volcanic hazards. Measuring spatial and temporal patterns of surface deformation in seismically active regions is extraordinarily useful for understanding rupture dynamics and estimating seismic risks. Measuring how landslides develop and activate is a prerequisite to minimizing associated hazards. Mapping surface subsidence or uplift related to extraction or injection of fluids during exploitation of groundwater aquifers or petroleum reservoirs provides fundamental data on aquifer or reservoir properties and improves our ability to mitigate undesired consequences. Monitoring dynamic water-level changes in wetlands improves hydrological modeling predictions and the assessment of future flood impacts. In addition, InSAR imagery can provide near-real-time estimates of fire scar extents and fire severity for wildfire management and control. All-weather satellite radar imagery is critical for studying various natural processes and is playing an increasingly important role in understanding and forecasting natural hazards. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Five ground-based differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (GB-DInSAR) surveys were conducted between 2005 and 2007 at the rock slope instability at Randa, Switzerland. Resultant displacement maps revealed, for the first time, the presence of an active basal rupture zone and a lateral release surface daylighting on the exposed 1991 failure scarp. Structures correlated with the boundaries of in- terferometric displacement domains were confirmed using a helicopter-based LiDAR DTM and oblique aerial photography. Former investigations at the site failed to conclusively detect these active release surfaces essential for kinematic and hazard analysis of the instability, although their existence had been hypothesized. The determination of the basal and lateral release planes also allowed a more accurate estimate of the currently unstable volume of 5.7± 1.5 million m3. The displacement patterns reveal that two different kinematic behaviors dominate the instability, i.e. toppling above 2200 m and translational failure below. In the toppling part of the instability the areas with the highest GB-DInSAR displacements correspond to areas of enhanced micro-seismic activity. The observation of only few strongly active discontinuities daylighting on the 1991 failure surface points to a rather uniform movement in the lower portion of the instability, while most of the slip occurs along the basal rupture plane. Comparison of GB-DInSAR displacements with mapped discontinuities revealed correlations between displacement patterns and active structures, although spatial offsets occur as a result of the effective resolution of GB- DInSAR. Similarly, comparisons with measurements from total station surveys generally showed good agreement. Discrepancies arose in several cases due to local movement of blocks, the size of which could not be resolved using GB-DInSAR.},

Frank Slide is a rock avalanche that occurred on the eastern slope of Turtle Mountain in 1903 and claimed more than 70 lives. At the foot of the eastern slope of Turtle Mountain, the ground surface above the Frank Mine was found to subside at an average rate of about 3.1 mm per year, relative to the reference area that is located in the middle part of the Frank Slide, during a period from April 2004 to October 2006. This may support the speculation, suggested for more than 100 years since the Frank landslide took place, that ground movements induced by the underground coal mines at the foot of Turtle Mountain might have triggered the slide. To the east of the Frank Slide debris, an average subsidence rate of up to 3.2 mm per year was observed for some areas overlying the footprint of the abandoned Bellevue underground mine during the same period.

	abstract = {European Remote Sensing satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are used to analyze terrain deformation in the area of Wieliczka, Poland using interferometric techniques. Terrain deformations in Wieliczka are due to (i) salt mining, (ii) catastrophic suffusion caused by water inflows to the mine and (iii) landslides in the southern part of the region. To discriminate between different deformation regimes differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) and persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) are used. A comparison with published information based on leveling data is performed. It can be concluded that rapid subsidence caused by catastrophic water inflow cannot be identified with InSAR techniques. However, both D-InSAR and PSI retrieve information about slow subsidence due to mine convergence. These data match with subsidence maps constructed from leveling data. A limited amount of coherent scatterers were identified on landslides. Some scatterers can be related to buildings with clear damage caused by landslide movement. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The coherent pixel technique is an advanced differential SAR interferometry technique that has been used for mapping and monitoring ground movements in La Union mining area (Murcia, SE Spain). This technique was originally used to monitor mining subsidence in La Unión Town but unknown ground instabilities were detected in an abandoned open pit mining area nearby. Measured displacements have been analyzed with respect to geometrical and geological factors that play a role in ground movements. Then a "blind test", consisting on geomorphological mapping of detected deformed areas, was performed in order to identify the existence of unknown active processes: slope instabilities and flat accumulation areas. Finally, a detailed analysis of these results has permitted to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of using this technique for mapping ground movements in mining areas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present a novel methodology for integration of multiple InSAR data sets for computation of two dimensional time series of ground deformation. The proposed approach allowscombination of SAR data acquired with different acquisition parameters, temporal and spatial sampling and resolution, wavelength and polarization. Produced time series have combined coverage, improved temporal resolution and lower noise level. We apply this methodology for mapping coal mining related ground subsidence and uplift in the Greater Region of Luxembourg along the French-German border. For this we processed 167 Synthetic Aperture Radar ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT images acquired between 1995 and 2009 from one ascending (track 29) and one descending (track 337) tracks and created over five hundred interferograms that were used for time series analysis. Derived vertical and east-west linear deformation rates show with remarkable precision a region of localized ground deformation located above and caused by mining and post-mining activities. Time series of ground deformation display temporal variability: reversal from subsidence to uplift and acceleration of subsidence in the vertical component, and horizontal motion toward the center of the subsidence on the east-west component. InSAR results are validated by leveling measurements collected by the French Geological Survey (BRGM) during 2006-2008. We determined that deformationrate changes are mainly caused by water level variations in the mines. Due to higher temporal and spatial resolution the proposed space-borne method detected a larger number of subsidence and uplift areas in comparison to leveling measurements restricted to annual monitoring of benchmark points along roads. We also identified one deformation region that is not precisely located above the mining sites. Comparison of InSAR measurements with the water levels measured in the mining pits suggest that part of the water that filled thegalleries after termination of the dewatering systems may come from this region. Providing that enough SAR data is available, this method opens new opportunities for detecting and locating man-made and natural ground deformation signals with high temporal resolution and precision. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A modified direct shear test apparatus was designed and used to measure cohesion and friction angle of rock pile materials. Two test apparatuses were constructed, a 30-cm square metal shear box and a 60-cm square metal shear box. In addition to the shear box, the testing apparatus has a metal top plate, a fabricated roller plate, normal and shear dial gages with wooden supports, and two hydraulic jacks and cylinders with a maximum oil pressure of 70 MPa (10,000 psi) and a load capacity of ten tons. The main difference between the in situ shear box and its conventional laboratory equivalent is that the in situ shear box consists of a single box that confines an excavated block of rock pile material. The lower half of the block consists of the rock pile material underneath the shear plane that is a semi-infinite domain. This modification in the shear test apparatus reduces the time needed for block preparation, helps perform several tests at different levels of the same sample block, and allows for accommodating large shear displacement with no reduction in the area of the shear plane.

	abstract = {Tunisia is submitted to numerous small topographic displacements due to both the geodynamic of the Eurasian-African plates' convergence, and to important anthropic actions such as oil production, underground water pumping, mine extraction and linked post-mining displacements. We propose herein to study the latter and locate, characterize, and quantify small topographic displacement fields due to the production of underground phosphate mines in central Tunisia. After having acquired and processed 17 radar images (ERS 1 and 2) of the central Tunisia (Gafsa area) through Differential Interferometry (DInSAR), we clearly observed local subsidence that we interprete as corresponding to mine exploitation of the underground Moulares Phosphates mines (southern Atlas of Tunisia). Field studies (circular normal faults located above the Phosphate extraction area) confirm the movement revealed by DinSAR. Also, DInSAR allows us to monitor temporal variations of the small vertical displacements on this specific area and since the collapse occurred near an urban area (Moulares city), this problem can be considered a potential anthropic risk. © 2011 Académie des sciences.},
